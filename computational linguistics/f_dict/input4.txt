“But not by you!” said Bellatrix furiously. “No, you 
were once again absent while the rest of us ran 
dangers, were you not, Snape?” 

“My orders were to remain behind,” said Snape. 
“Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps 
you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if 
I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the 
Order of the Phoenix? And — forgive me — you speak 
of dangers ... you were facing six teenagers, were you 
not?” 

“They were joined, as you very well know, by half of 
the Order before long!” snarled Bellatrix. “And, while 
we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you 
cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, 
don’t you?” 

“I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name 
of the place. You understand how the enchantment 
works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the 
information I have passed him on the Order. It led, as 
perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and 
murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped 
dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit 
for finishing him off.” 

He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression 
did not soften. 

“You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry 
Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the 
past five years. You have not done it. Why?” 

“Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?” 
asked Snape. 

“He ... lately, we ... I am asking you, Snape!” 



Page | 34 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could 
not have used his blood to regenerate, making him 
invincible — ” 

“You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she 
jeered. 

“I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have 
already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. 

I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is 
not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year 
ago. ...” 

“But why did you keep him alive?” 

“Have you not understood me? It was only 
Dumbledore’s protection that was keeping me out of 
Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite 
student might have turned him against me? But there 
was more to it than that. I should remind you that 
when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still 
many stories circulating about him, rumors that he 
himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he 
had survived the Dark Lord’s attack. Indeed, many of 
the Dark Lord’s old followers thought Potter might be 
a standard around which we could all rally once 
more. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined 
to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle. 

“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly 
that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has 
fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a 
simple combination of sheer luck and more talented 
friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as 
obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before 
him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out 
of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but 
kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I 



Page | 35 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore 
close at hand.” 

“And through all this we are supposed to believe 
Dumbledore has never suspected you?” asked 
Bellatrix. “He has no idea of your true allegiance, he 
trusts you implicitly still?” 

“I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you 
overlook Dumbledore’s greatest weakness: He has to 
believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest 
remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death 
Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms — 
though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark 
Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a 
great wizard — oh yes, he has,” (for Bellatrix had 
made a scathing noise), “the Dark Lord acknowledges 
it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is 
growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month 
shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury 
because his reactions are slower than they once were. 
But through all these years, he has never stopped 
trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great 
value to the Dark Lord.” 

Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared 
unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking 
advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister. 

“Now ... you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?” 

Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with 
despair. 

“Yes, Severus. I — I think you are the only one who 
can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in 
jail and ...” 



Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from 
beneath her eyelids. 

“The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” 
Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. “He wishes 
none to know of the plan. It is ... very secret. But — ” 

“If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,” said 
Snape at once. “The Dark Lord’s word is law.” 

Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with 
cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time 
since she had entered the house. 

“There!” she said triumphantly to her sister. “Even 
Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your 
silence!” 

But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the 
small window, peered through the curtains at the 
deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. 

He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning. 

“It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a 
low voice. “I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. 
Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, 

Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great 
treachery to the Dark Lord.” 

“I thought you must know about it!” said Narcissa, 
breathing more freely. “He trusts you so, Severus. ...” 

“You know about the plan?” said Bellatrix, her fleeting 
expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of 
outrage. “ You know?” 

“Certainly,” said Snape. “But what help do you 
require, Narcissa? If you are imagining I can persuade 



Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is 
no hope, none at all.” 

“Severus,” she whispered, tears sliding down her pale 
cheeks. “My son ... my only son ...” 

“Draco should be proud,” said Bellatrix indifferently. 
“The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor. And I 
will say this for Draco: He isn’t shrinking away from 
his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, 
excited at the prospect — ” 

Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly 
all the while at Snape. 

“That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what 
lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too 
dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius’s mistake, I 
know it!” 

Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of 
her tears as though they were indecent, but he could 
not pretend not to hear her. 

“That’s why he’s chosen Draco, isn’t it?” she 
persisted. “To punish Lucius?” 

“If Draco succeeds,” said Snape, still looking away 
from her, “he will be honored above all others.” 

“But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa. “How can 
he, when the Dark Lord himself — ?” 

Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve. 

“I only meant ... that nobody has yet succeeded. ... 
Severus ... please ... You are, you have always been, 
Draco’s favorite teacher. ... You are Lucius’s old 
friend. ... I beg you. ... You are the Dark Lord’s 

Page | 38 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




favorite, his most trusted advisor. ... Will you speak to 
him, persuade him — ?” 

“The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not 
stupid enough to attempt it,” said Snape flatly. “I 
cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with 
Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got 
himself captured, along with how many others, and 
failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, 
the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.” 

“Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!” 
choked Narcissa. “He does not mean him to succeed, 
he wants him to be killed trying!” 

When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose 
what little self-restraint she still possessed. Standing 
up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his 
robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his 
chest, she gasped, “You could do it. You could do it 
instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of 
course you would, and he would reward you beyond 
all of us — ” 

Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her 
clutching hands. Looking down into her tears tained 
face, he said slowly, “He intends me to do it in the 
end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should 
try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco 
succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little 
longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.” 

“In other words, it doesn’t matter to him if Draco is 
killed!” 

“The Dark Lord is very angry,” repeated Snape 
quietly. “He failed to hear the prophecy. You know as 
well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.” 



Page | 39 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and 
moaning on the floor. 



“My only son ... my only son ...” 

“You should be proud!” said Bellatrix ruthlessly. “If I 
had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the 
service of the Dark Lord!” 

Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched 
at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by 
the arms, lifted her up, and steered her back onto the 
sofa. He then poured her more wine and forced the 
glass into her hand. 

“Narcissa, that’s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.” 

She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she 
took a shaky sip. 

“It might be possible ... for me to help Draco.” 

She sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge. 

“Severus — oh, Severus — you would help him? 

Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?” 

“I can try.” 

She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table 
as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at 
Snape ’s feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and 
pressed her lips to it. 

“If you are there to protect him ... Severus, will you 
swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?” 

“The Unbreakable Vow?” 

Page | 40 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




Snape’s expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, 
however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter. 

“Aren’t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he’ll try, I’m sure. 
... The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of 
action ... oh, on the Dark Lord’s orders, of course!” 

Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were 
fixed upon Narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as she 
continued to clutch his hand. 

“Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable 
Vow,” he said quietly. “Perhaps your sister will 
consent to be our Bonder.” 

Bellatrix’s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so 
that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath 
Bellatrix’s astonished gaze, they grasped right hands. 

“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape 
coldly. 

She drew it, still looking astonished. 

“And you will need to move a little closer,” he said. 

She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and 
placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands. 

Narcissa spoke. 

“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he 
attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes?” 

“I will,” said Snape. 

A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand 
and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot 
wire. 

Page | 41 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him 
from harm?” 

“I will,” said Snape. 

A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and 
interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing 
chain. 

“And, should it prove necessary ... if it seems Draco 
will fail ...” whispered Narcissa (Snape’s hand 
twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), “will 
you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has 
ordered Draco to perform?” 

There was a moment’s silence. Bellatrix watched, her 
wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide. 

“I will,” said Snape. 

Bellatrix’s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a 
third tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, 
twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly 
around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery 
snake.

WILL AND WON’T 

Harry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting 
in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best 
part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, 
and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face 
pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses 
askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his 
breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange 
glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light 
drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly 
beneath his shock of untidy black hair. 

The room was strewn with various possessions and a 
good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, 
and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of 
spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled 
robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a 
puddle of light on his desk. The headline of one 
blared: 

HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE? 



Page | 43 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent 
disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which 
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted once more. 

“We’re not allowed to talk about it, don’t ask me 
anything,” said one agitated Obliviator, who refused 
to give his name as he left the Ministry last night. 

Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the 
Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance 
centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy. 

Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused 
even to confirm the existence of such a place, a 
growing number of the Wizarding community believe 
that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in 
Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were 
attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that 
prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife 
that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever 
known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is 
also known to have been at the Ministry on the night 
in question. Some are going so far as to call Potter 
“the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names 
him as the only one who will be able to rid us of He- 
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 

The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, 
are unknown, although (ctd. page 2, column 5) 

A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore 
the headline: 

SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE 

Most of this front page was taken up with a large 
black-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike mane 
of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The picture 
was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling. 

Page | 44 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office 
in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has 
succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The 
appointment has largely been greeted with 
enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though 
rumors of a rift between the new Minister and Albus 
Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the 
Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour 
taking office. 

Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he had met 
with Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the 
top job, but refused to comment on the topics under 
discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd. page 
3, column 2) 

To the left of this paper sat another, which had been 
folded so that a story bearing the title MINISTRY 
GUARANTEES STUDENTS’ SAFETY was visible. 

Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus 
Scrimgeour, spoke today of the tough new measures 
taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students 
returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry this autumn. 

“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going 
into detail about its stringent new security plans,” 
said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that 
measures include defensive spells and charms, a 
complex array of countercurses, and a small task 
force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of 
Hogwarts School. 

Most seem reassured by the new Minister’s tough 
stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta 
Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good friend of 
Harry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death 
Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and —

But the rest of this story was obscured by the large 
birdcage standing on top of it. Inside it was a 
magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the 
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to 
gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked 
her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep 
to hear her. 

A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its 
lid was open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost 
empty but for a residue of old underwear, sweets, 
empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the 
very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet 
emblazoned with the words: 

— ISSUED ON BEHALF OF — 

THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC 

PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY 

AGAINST DARK FORCES 

The Wizarding community is currently under threat 
from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. 
Observing the following simple security guidelines will 
help protect you, your family, and your home from 
attack. 

1. You are advised not to leave the house alone. 

2. Particular care should be taken during the 
hours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to 
complete journeys before night has fallen. 

3. Review the security arrangements around your 
house, making sure that all family members are 
aware of emergency measures such as Shield and 



Page | 46 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Disillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage 
family members, Side-Along-Apparition. 

4. Agree on security questions with close friends 
and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading 
as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2). 

5. Should you feel that a family member, 
colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange 
manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad 
at once. They may have been put under the Imperius 
Curse (see page 4). 

6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling 
place or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact 
the Auror office immediately. 

7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death 
Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any 
sighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, 
should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY. 

Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the 
window an inch or so, making his glasses still more 
lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, 
repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on 
the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held 
in place by Harry’s relaxed hand, was a piece of 
parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry 
had read this letter so often since its arrival three 
days ago that although it had been delivered in a 
tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat. 

Dear Harry, 

If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, 
Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort 
you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to 
spend the remainder of your school holidays. 

Page | 47 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your 
assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the 
way to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when 
I see you. 

Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping 
to see you this Friday, 

I am, yours most sincerely, 

Albus Dumbledore 

Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been 
stealing glances at this missive every few minutes 
since seven o’clock that evening, when he had first 
taken up his position beside his bedroom window, 
which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet 
Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading 
Dumbledore ’s words; Harry had sent back his “yes” 
with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could 
do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to 
come, or he was not. 

But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to 
be true that he was going to be rescued from the 
Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He 
could not shrug off the feeling that something was 
going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore ’s letter 
might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be 
prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn 
out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or 
joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing 
and then being let down and having to unpack again. 
The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a 
journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in 
her cage. 



Page | 48 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the 
number twelve and, at that precise moment, the 
streetlamp outside the window went out. 

Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an 
alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and 
unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his 
nose against the window instead and squinted down 
at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing 
cloak was walking up the garden path. 

Harry jumped up as though he had received an 
electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started 
snatching anything and everything within reach from 
the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he 
lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of 
crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs 
in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, “Who 
the blazes is calling at this time of night?” 

Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a 
pair of trainers in the other. He had completely 
forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore 
might be coming. Feeling both panicky and close to 
laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched 
open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice 
say, “Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I 
daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for 
him?” 

Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an 
abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long 
experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s 
reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the 
doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length 
silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were 
perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a 
long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat. Vernon 
Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as 
Page | 49 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore ’s, though black, and who was wearing a 
puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as 
though he could not believe his tiny eyes. 

“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did 
not warn you that I was coming,” said Dumbledore 
pleasantly. “However, let us assume that you have 
invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to 
linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.” 

He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the 
front door behind him. 

“It is a long time since my last visit,” said 
Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle 
Vernon. “I must say, your agapanthus are 
flourishing.” 

Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not 
doubt that speech would return to him, and soon — 
the vein pulsing in his uncle’s temple was reaching 
danger point — but something about Dumbledore 
seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It 
might have been the blatant wizardishness of his 
appearance, but it might, too, have been that even 
Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom 
it would be very difficult to bully. 

“Ah, good evening Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking 
up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most 
satisfied expression. “Excellent, excellent.” 

These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was 
clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who 
could look at Harry and say “excellent” was a man 
with whom he could never see eye to eye. 

“I don’t mean to be rude — ” he began, in a tone that 
threatened rudeness in every syllable. 

Page | 50 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“ — yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly 
often,” Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. 
“Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this 
must be Petunia.” 

The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s 
aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her 
nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre- 
bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her 
rather horsey face registered nothing but shock. 

“Albus Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore, when Uncle 
Vernon failed to effect an introduction. “We have 
corresponded, of course.” Harry thought this an odd 
way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent 
her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not 
challenge the term. “And this must be your son, 
Dudley?” 

Dudley had that moment peered round the living 
room door. His large, blond head rising out of the 
stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, 
his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear. 
Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to 
see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say 
anything, but as the silence stretched on he smiled. 

“Shall we assume that you have invited me into your 
sitting room? 

Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore 
passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and 
trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed 
Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair 
nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings 
with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite 
extraordinarily out of place. 



Page | 51 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Aren’t — aren’t we leaving, sir?” Harry asked 
anxiously. 

“Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we 
need to discuss first,” said Dumbledore. “And I would 
prefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass 
upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality only a little 
longer.” 

“You will, will you?” 

Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his 
shoulder, and Dudley skulking behind them both. 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore simply, “I shall.” 

He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; 
with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and 
knocked the knees out from under all three of the 
Dursley s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. 
Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back 
to its original position. 

“We may as well be comfortable,” said Dumbledore 
pleasantly. 

As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that 
his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as 
though his flesh had been burned away. 

“Sir — what happened to your — ?” 

“Later, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Please sit down.” 

Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to 
look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into 
silence. 



Page | 52 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I would assume that you were going to offer me 
refreshment,” Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, “but 
the evidence so far suggests that that would be 
optimistic to the point of foolishness.” 

A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five 
glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and 
poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid 
into each of the glasses, which then floated to each 
person in the room. 

“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said 
Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught 
hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted 
anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The 
Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, 
tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, 
as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their 
heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that 
Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself. 

“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, turning toward him, 
“a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able 
to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the 
Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius’s 
will was discovered a week ago and that he left you 
everything he owned.” 

Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but 
Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of 
anything to say except, “Oh. Right.” 

“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” 
Dumbledore went on. “You add a reasonable amount 
of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit 
all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The slightly 
problematic part of the legacy — ” 



Page | 53 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from 
the sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look 
at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite 
insistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he attempted 
to beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he 
had not confided in the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he 
continued to Harry, as if there had been no 
interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number 
twelve, Grimmauld Place.” 

“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, 
his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him. 

“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. 

“I don’t care. You can have it, I don’t really want it.” 
Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, 
Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought 
he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius 
prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned 
within the place he had wanted so desperately to 
leave. 

“That is generous,” said Dumbledore. “We have, 
however, vacated the building temporarily.” 

“Why?” 

“Well,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of 
Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly 
over the head by the persistent glass of mead, “Black 
family tradition decreed that the house was handed 
down the direct line, to the next male with the name 
of ‘Black. ’ Sirius was the very last of the line as his 
younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both 
were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain 
that he wants you to have the house, it is 
nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment 
Page | 54 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot 
be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.” 



A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of 
Sirius’s mother that hung in the hall of number 
twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry’s mind. “I 
bet there has,” he said. 

“Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an 
enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house 
is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living 
relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix 
Lestrange.” 

Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to 
his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled 
across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius’s killer, 
inherit his house? 

“No,” he said. 

“Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it 
either,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The situation is 
fraught with complications. We do not know whether 
the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, 
for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that 
ownership has passed from Sirius’s hands. It might 
be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any 
moment. Naturally we had to move out until such 
time as we have clarified the position.” 

“But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to 
own it?” 

“Fortunately,” said Dumbledore, “there is a simple 
test.” 

He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his 
chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle 

Page | 55 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Vernon shouted, “ Will you get these ruddy things off 
us?” 

Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were 
cowering with their arms over their heads as their 
glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their 
contents flying everywhere. 

“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Dumbledore politely, and he 
raised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. 

“But it would have been better manners to drink it, 
you know.” 

It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with 
any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely 
shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes 
on Dumbledore ’s wand. 

“You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry 
and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not 
uttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you 
have also inherited — ” 

He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud 
crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a 
nose, giant bat’s ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, 
crouching on the Dursleys’ shag carpet and covered 
in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising 
shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in 
living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet 
off the floor and sat with them raised almost above 
his head, as though he thought the creature might 
run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon 
bellowed, “What the hell is that?” 

“Kreacher,” finished Dumbledore. 



Page | 56 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t!” 
croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle 
Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling 
his ears. “Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, 
Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his 
new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, 
Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t — ” 

“As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over 
Kreacher’s continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” 
“Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into 
your ownership.” 

“I don’t care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust 
at the writhing, stamping house-elf. “I don’t want 
him.” 

“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ” 

“You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of 
Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived 
at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for 
the past year?” 

“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ” 

Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher 
could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix 
Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having 
responsibility for the creature that had betrayed 
Sirius, was repugnant. 

“Give him an order,” said Dumbledore. “If he has 
passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If 
not, then we shall have to think of some other means 
of keeping him from his rightful mistress.” 

“Won’t, won’t, won’t, WON’T.” 



Page | 57 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Kreacher’s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could 
think of nothing to say, except, “Kreacher, shut up!” 

It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going 
to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still 
working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few 
seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face 
forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) 
and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving 
himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum. 

“Well, that simplifies matters,” said Dumbledore 
cheerfully. “It seems that Sirius knew what he was 
doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, 
Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.” 

“Do I — do I have to keep him with me?” Harry asked, 
aghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. 

“Not if you don’t want to,” said Dumbledore. “If I 
might make a suggestion, you could send him to 
Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, 
the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry in relief, “yeah, I’ll do that. Er — 
Kreacher — I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in 
the kitchens there with the other house-elves.” 

Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his 
arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down 
look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, 
vanished. 

“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of 
the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking 
after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours 
now, so if you would prefer to make different 
arrangements — ” 



Page | 58 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I 
think Buckbeak would prefer that.” 

“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. 
“He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, 
we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak’s 
safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time 
being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever 
guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to 
death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?” 

“Erm ...” 

“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore 
suggested shrewdly. 

“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, 
hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers. 

It took him a little over ten minutes to track down 
everything he needed; at last he had managed to 
extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, 
screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, 
and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. 
Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding 
Hedwig’s cage in the other, he made his way back 
downstairs. 

He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was 
not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to 
return to the living room. 

Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming 
quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the 
atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry 
did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, 

“Professor — I’m ready now.” 



Page | 59 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Just one last thing, then.” 
And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more. 

“As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in 
a year’s time — ” 

“No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time 
since Dumbledore’s arrival. 

“I’m sorry?” said Dumbledore politely. 

“No, he doesn’t. He’s a month younger than Dudley, 
and Dudders doesn’t turn eighteen until the year after 
next.” 

“Ah,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but in the 
Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.” 

Uncle Vernon muttered, “Preposterous,” but 
Dumbledore ignored him. 

“Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord 
Voldemort has returned to this country. The 
Wizarding community is currently in a state of open 
warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already 
attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even 
greater danger now than the day when I left him upon 
your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter 
explaining about his parents’ murder and expressing 
the hope that you would care for him as though he 
were your own.” 

Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained 
light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, 
Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and 
noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer 
together. 



Page | 60 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated 
Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect 
and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be 
said is that he has at least escaped the appalling 
damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy 
sitting between you.” 

Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around 
instinctively, as though expecting to see someone 
other than Dudley squeezed between them. 

“Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you — ?” began 
Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his 
finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he 
had struck Uncle Vernon dumb. 

“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that 
Harry has powerful protection while he can still call 
this house ‘home.’ However miserable he has been 
here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you 
have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. 
This magic will cease to operate the moment that 
Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment 
he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow 
Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his 
seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the 
protection continues until that time.” 

None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was 
frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to 
work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle 
Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in 
his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed. 

“Well, Harry ... time for us to be off,” said Dumbledore 
at last, standing up and straightening his long black 
cloak. “Until we meet again,” he said to the Dursleys, 
who looked as though that moment could wait forever 



Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his 
hat, he swept from the room. 

“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed 
Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry’s trunk, upon 
which Hedwig’s cage was perched. 

“We do not want to be encumbered by these just 
now,” he said, pulling out his wand again. “I shall 
send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I 
would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just 
in case.” 

Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some 
difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess 
within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket 
of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the 
trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then 
waved his wand again, and the front door opened 
onto cool, misty darkness. 

“And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and 
pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”

HORACE SLUGHORN 

Despite the fact that he had spent every waking 
moment of the past few days hoping desperately that 
Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry 
felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet 
Drive together. He had never had a proper 
conversation with the headmaster outside of 
Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between 
them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter 
kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry’s 
sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that 
occasion, not to mention done his best to smash 
several of Dumbledore ’s most prized possessions. 

Dumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed. 

“Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,” he said 
brightly. 

“But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside 
school, sir?” 



Page | 63 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“If there is an attack,” said Dumbledore, “I give you 
permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might 
occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry 
about being attacked tonight.” 

“Why not, sir?” 

“You are with me,” said Dumbledore simply. “This will 
do, Harry.” 

He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive. 

“You have not, of course, passed your Apparition 
Test,” he said. 

“No,” said Harry. “I thought you had to be seventeen?” 

“You do,” said Dumbledore. “So you will need to hold 
on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you don’t mind — 
as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at 
the moment.” 

Harry gripped Dumbledore’s proffered forearm. 

“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Well, here we go.” 

Harry felt Dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and 
redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything 
went black; he was being pressed very hard from all 
directions; he could not breathe, there were iron 
bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were 
being forced back into his head; his eardrums were 
being pushed deeper into his skull and then — 

He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened 
his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just 
been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a 
few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had 
vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in 
Page | 64 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the 
center of which stood an old war memorial and a few 
benches. His comprehension catching up with his 
senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for 
the first time in his life. 

“Are you all right?” asked Dumbledore, looking down 
at him solicitously. “The sensation does take some 
getting used to.” 

“I’m fine,” said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as 
though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. 
“But I think I might prefer brooms. ...” 

Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little 
more tightly around his neck, and said, “This way.” 

He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a 
few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, 
it was almost midnight. 

“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Your scar ... 
has it been hurting at all?” 

Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead 
and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark. 

“No,” he said, “and IVe been wondering about that. I 
thought it would be burning all the time now 
Voldemort’s getting so powerful again.” 

He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was 
wearing a satisfied expression. 

“I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,” said 
Dumbledore. “Lord Voldemort has finally realized the 
dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you 
have been enjoying. It appears that he is now 
employing Occlumency against you.” 

Page | 65 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I’m not complaining,” said Harry, who missed 
neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling 
flashes of insight into Voldemort’s mind. 

They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a 
bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore 
again. “Professor?” 

“Harry?” 

“Er — where exactly are we?” 

“This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh 
Babberton.” 

“And what are we doing here?” 

“Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said 
Dumbledore. “Well, I have lost count of the number of 
times I have said this in recent years, but we are, 
once again, one member of staff short. We are here to 
persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of 
retirement and return to Hogwarts.” 

“How can I help with that, sir?” 

“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dumbledore 
vaguely. “Left here, Harry.” 

They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with 
houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that 
had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here 
too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his 
shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his 
pocket. 

“Professor, why couldn’t we just Apparate directly into 
your old colleague’s house?” 



Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down 
the front door,” said Dumbledore. “Courtesy dictates 
that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying 
us entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are 
magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At 
Hogwarts, for instance — ” 

“ — you can’t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings 
or grounds,” said Harry quickly. “Hermione Granger 
told me.” 

“And she is quite right. We turn left again.” 

The church clock chimed midnight behind them. 

Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it 
rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that 
conversation had been established, he had more 
pressing questions to ask. 

“Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been 
sacked. ...” 

“Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep 
side street. “He has been replaced, as I am sure you 
also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head 
of the Auror office.” 

“Is he ... Do you think he’s good?” asked Harry. 

“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore. “He is 
able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful 
personality than Cornelius.” 

“Yes, but I meant — ” 

“I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action 
and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his 
working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.” 



Page | 67 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything 
about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the 
Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the 
nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it. “And ... 
sir ... I saw about Madam Bones.” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore quietly. “A terrible loss. She 
was a great witch. Just up here, I think — ouch.” 

He had pointed with his injured hand. 

“Professor, what happened to your — ?” 

“I have no time to explain now,” said Dumbledore. “It 
is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.” 

He smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not 
being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep 
asking questions. 

“Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about 
security measures we should all take against the 
Death Eaters. ...” 

“Yes, I received one myself,” said Dumbledore, still 
smiling. “Did you find it useful?” 

“Not really.” 

“No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for 
instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check 
that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an 
impostor.” 

“I didn’t ...” Harry began, not entirely sure whether he 
was being reprimanded or not. 

“For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry ... 
although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would 

Page | 68 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




have been sure to research my own jam preferences 
before impersonating myself.” 

“Er ... right,” said Harry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said 
something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The 
leaflet wasn’t very clear.” 

“They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Dead 
bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark 
wizard’s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long 
time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful. 

. . . He killed enough people to make an army of them, 
of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. ...” 

They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its 
own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible 
idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything 
else, but as they reached the front gate, Dumbledore 
stopped dead and Harry walked into him. 

“Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.” 

Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front 
path and felt his heart sink. The front door was 
hanging off its hinges. 

Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It 
seemed quite deserted. 

“Wand out and follow me, Harry,” he said quietly. 

He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up 
the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the 
front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the 
ready. 

“Lumos.” 



Page | 69 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore ’s wand tip ignited, casting its light up a 
narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. 
Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore 
walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind 
him. 

A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A 
grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face 
cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a 
dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys 
strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen 
chandelier glittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, 
feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments 
of glass and china lay like powder over everything. 
Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its 
light was thrown upon the walls, where something 
darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the 
wallpaper. Harry’s small intake of breath made 
Dumbledore look around. 

“Not pretty, is it?” he said heavily. “Yes, something 
horrible has happened here.” 

Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the 
room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry 
followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might 
see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the 
overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body. 

“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him 
off, Professor?” Harry suggested, trying not to imagine 
how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave 
those stains spattered halfway up the walls. 

“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore quietly, peering 
behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side. 

“You mean he’s — ?” 



Page | 70 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Still here somewhere? Yes.” 



And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging 
the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed 
armchair, which yelled, “Ouch!” 

“Good evening, Horace,” said Dumbledore, 
straightening up again. 

Harry’s jaw dropped. Where a split second before 
there had been an armchair, there now crouched an 
enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his 
lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an 
aggrieved and watery eye. 

“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” 
he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. “It hurt.” 

The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his 
prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike 
mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the 
maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of 
lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached 
Dumbledore ’s chin. 

“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to 
his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed 
remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been 
discovered pretending to be an armchair. 

“My dear Horace,” said Dumbledore, looking amused, 
“if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark 
Mark would have been set over the house.” 

The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast 
forehead. 

“The Dark Mark,” he muttered. “Knew there was 
something ... ah well. Wouldn’t have had time 

Page | 71 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




anyway, I’d only just put the finishing touches to my 
upholstery when you entered the room.” 

He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his 
mustache flutter. 

“Would you like my assistance clearing up?” asked 
Dumbledore politely. 

“Please,” said the other. 

They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the 
short round one, and waved their wands in one 
identical sweeping motion. 

The furniture flew back to its original places; 
ornaments reformed in midair, feathers zoomed into 
their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as 
they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared 
onto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of 
splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across 
the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon 
a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, 
and the walls wiped themselves clean. 

“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked 
Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly 
unsmashed grandfather clock. 

“On the walls? Dragon,” shouted the wizard called 
Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, 
the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling. 

There was a final plunk from the piano, and silence. 

“Yes, dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally. 
“My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the 
moment. Still, it might be reusable.” 



Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on 
top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, 
examining the thick liquid within. 

“Hmm. Bit dusty.” 

He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It 
was then that his gaze fell upon Harry. 

“Oho,” he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry’s 
forehead and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. “Ohol” 

“This,” said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the 
introduction, “is Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old 
friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.” 

Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression 
shrewd. “So that’s how you thought you’d persuade 
me, is it? Well, the answer’s no, Albus.” 

He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely 
away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation. 

“I suppose we can have a drink, at least?” asked 
Dumbledore. “For old time’s sake?” 

Slughorn hesitated. 

“All right then, one drink,” he said ungraciously. 

Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward 
a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so 
recently impersonated, which stood right beside the 
newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. 
Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that 
Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as 
visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had 
been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face 
the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.

“Hmpf,” he said, looking away quickly as though 
frightened of hurting his eyes. “Here — ” He gave a 
drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without 
invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank 
into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a 
disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did 
not touch the floor. 

“Well, how have you been keeping, Horace?” 
Dumbledore asked. 

“Not so well,” said Slughorn at once. “Weak chest. 
Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can’t move like I used to. 
Well, that’s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.” 

“And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to 
prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,” 
said Dumbledore. “You can’t have had more than 
three minutes’ warning?” 

Slughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, “Two. 

Didn’t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a 
bath. Still,” he added sternly, seeming to pull himself 
back together again, “the fact remains that I’m an old 
man, Albus. A tired old man who’s earned the right to 
a quiet life and a few creature comforts.” 

He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking 
around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet 
nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were 
soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of 
chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not 
known who lived there, he would have guessed at a 
rich, fussy old lady. 

“You’re not yet as old as I am, Horace,” said 
Dumbledore. 



Page | 74 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement 
yourself,” said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry 
eyes had found Dumbledore ’s injured hand. 

“Reactions not what they were, I see.” 

“You’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, 
shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those 
burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made 
the back of Harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly. “I am 
undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other 
hand ...” 

He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to 
say that age had its compensations, and Harry 
noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had 
never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, 
rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and 
was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked 
down the middle. Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a 
moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown 
momentarily crease his wide forehead. 

“So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace 
... are they for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or mine?” 
asked Dumbledore. 

“What would the Death Eaters want with a poor 
broken-down old buffer like me?” demanded 
Slughorn. 

“I imagine that they would want you to turn your 
considerable talents to coercion, torture, and 
murder,” said Dumbledore. “Are you really telling me 
that they haven’t come recruiting yet?” 

Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, 
then muttered, “I haven’t given them the chance. I’ve 
been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place 
more than a week. Move from Muggle house to 

Page | 75 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Muggle house — the owners of this place are on 
holiday in the Canary Islands — it’s been very 
pleasant, I’ll be sorry to leave. It’s quite easy once you 
know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these 
absurd burglar alarms they use instead of 
Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don’t 
spot you bringing in the piano.” 

“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “But it sounds a rather 
tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in 
search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to 
Hogwarts — ” 

“If you’re going to tell me my life would be more 
peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your 
breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some 
funny rumors have reached me since Dolores 
Umbridge left! If that’s how you treat teachers these 
days — ” 

“Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” 
said Dumbledore. “I think you, Horace, would have 
known better than to stride into the forest and call a 
horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds.’ ” 

“That’s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn. “Idiotic 
woman. Never liked her.” 

Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn 
looked round at him. 

“Sorry,” Harry said hastily. “It’s just — I didn’t like 
her either.” 

Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly. 

“Are you leaving?” asked Slughorn at once, looking 
hopeful. 



Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, I was wondering whether I might use your 
bathroom,” said Dumbledore. 

“Oh,” said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. “Second on 
the left down the hall.” 

Dumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had 
closed behind him, there was silence. After a few 
moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed 
uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive 
look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his 
back on it, warming his wide behind. 

“Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you,” he 
said abruptly. 

Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn ’s watery 
eyes slid over Harry’s scar, this time taking in the rest 
of his face. 

“You look very like your father.” 

“Yeah, I’ve been told,” said Harry. 

“Except for your eyes. You’ve got — ” 

“My mother’s eyes, yeah.” Harry had heard it so often 
he found it a bit wearing. 

“Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have favorites as a 
teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your 
mother,” Slughorn added, in answer to Harry’s 
questioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I 
ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I 
used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. 
Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.” 

“Which was your House?” 



Page | 77 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” 
he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry’s 
face and wagging a stubby finger at him, “don’t go 
holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, 

I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not 
always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must 
have done — been in the papers for the last couple of 
years — died a few weeks ago — ” 

It was as though an invisible hand had twisted 
Harry’s intestines and held them tight. 

“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at 
school. The whole Black family had been in my 
House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame — 
he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, 
when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.” 

He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had 
been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, 
he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot 
to ensure an even heat on his backside. 

“Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’t 
believe it when I found out. Thought she must have 
been pure-blood, she was so good.” 

“One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry, 
“and she’s the best in our year.” 

“Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?” said 
Slughorn. 

“Not really,” said Harry coldly. 

Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. “You 
mustn’t think I’m prejudiced!” he said. “No, no, no! 
Haven’t I just said your mother was one of my all-time 
favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in 

Page | 78 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the year after her too — now Head of the Goblin 
Liaison Office, of course — another Muggle-born, a 
very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside 
information on the goings-on at Gringotts!” 

He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self- 
satisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering 
photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with 
tiny moving occupants. 

“All ex-students, all signed. You’ll notice Barnabas 
Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he’s always 
interested to hear my take on the day’s news. And 
Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper every 
birthday, and all because I was able to give him an 
introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his 
first job! And at the back — you’ll see her if you just 
crane your neck — that’s Gwenog Jones, who of 
course captains the Holyhead Harpies. ... People are 
always astonished to hear I’m on first-name terms 
with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want 
them!” 

This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously. 

“And all these people know where to find you, to send 
you stuff?” asked Harry, who could not help 
wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked 
down Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch 
tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions 
could find him. 

The smile slid from Slughorn ’s face as quickly as the 
blood from his walls. 

“Of course not,” he said, looking down at Harry. “I 
have been out of touch with everybody for a year.” 



Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had the impression that the words shocked 
Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a 
moment. Then he shrugged. 

“Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in 
such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but 
taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be 
tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the 
Order of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very 
admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t 
personally fancy the mortality rate — ” 

“You don’t have to join the Order to teach at 
Hogwarts,” said Harry, who could not quite keep a 
note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to 
sympathize with Slughorn ’s cosseted existence when 
he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living 
on rats. “Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of 
them has ever been killed — well, unless you count 
Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he 
was working with Voldemort.” 

Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those 
wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort’s name 
spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn 
gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry 
ignored. 

“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while 
Dumbledore ’s headmaster; he’s supposed to be the 
only one Voldemort ever feared, isn’t he?” Harry went 
on. 

Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He 
seemed to be thinking over Harry’s words. 

“Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named 
has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,” he 
muttered grudgingly. “And I suppose one could argue 

Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




that as I have not joined the Death Eaters, He-Who- 
Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend ... 
in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to 
Albus. ... I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’s death 
did not shake me. ... If she, with all her Ministry 
contacts and protection ...” 

Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn 
jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the 
house. 

“Oh, there you are, Albus,” he said. “You’ve been a 
very long time. Upset stomach?” 

“No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,” 
said Dumbledore. “I do love knitting patterns. Well, 
Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace’s hospitality 
quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.” 

Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. 
Slughorn seemed taken aback. 

“You’re leaving?” 

“Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see 
one.” 

“Lost... ?” 

Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat 
thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore 
fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket. 

“Well, I’m sorry you don’t want the job, Horace,” said 
Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell 
salute. “Hogwarts would have been glad to see you 
back again. Our greatly increased security 
notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, 
should you wish to.” 

Page | 81 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“Yes ... well ... very gracious ... as I say ...” 



“Good-bye, then.” 

“Bye,” said Harry. 

They were at the front door when there was a shout 
from behind them. 

“All right, all right, 111 do it!” 

Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing 
breathless in the doorway to the sitting room. 

“You will come out of retirement?” 

“Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently. “I must be mad, 
but yes.” 

“Wonderful,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Then, 
Horace, we shall see you on the first of September.” 

“Yes, I daresay you will,” grunted Slughorn. 

As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn ’s voice 
floated after them, “111 want a pay rise, Dumbledore!” 

Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut 
behind them, and they set off back down the hill 
through the dark and the swirling mist. 

“Well done, Harry,” said Dumbledore. 

“I didn’t do anything,” said Harry in surprise. 

“Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how 
much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did 
you like him?” 



Page | 82 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Er ...” 



Harry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. 
He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he 
had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the 
contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born 
should make a good witch. 

“Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the 
responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort. He 
also likes the company of the famous, the successful, 
and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he 
influences these people. He has never wanted to 
occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat — 
more room to spread out, you see. He used to 
handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their 
ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm 
or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for 
choosing those who would go on to become 
outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a 
kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, 
making introductions, forging useful contacts 
between members, and always reaping some kind of 
benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite 
crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the 
next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office.” 

Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great 
swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a 
thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies 
a little closer. 

“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to 
turn you against Horace — or, as we must now call 
him, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your 
guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. 
You would be the jewel of his collection; ‘the Boy Who 
Lived’ ... or, as they call you these days, ‘the Chosen 
One.’” 

Page | 83 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the 
surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded 
of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that 
had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither 
can live while the other survives . . . 

Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the 
church they had passed earlier. 

“This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.” 

Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, 
but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure 
disappeared and he found himself able to breathe 
again, he was standing in a country lane beside 
Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked 
silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: 
the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had 
just swept through him, his spirits could not help but 
lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there ... and so was 
Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he 
knew. ... 

“If you don’t mind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, as they 
passed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with 
you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?” 

Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone 
outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. 
A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through 
the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the 
average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of 
his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled 
down at Harry. 

“I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, 
but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you 
seem to be coping after everything that happened at 



Page | 84 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius 
would have been proud of you.” 

Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted 
him. He did not think he could stand to discuss 
Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle 
Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even worse to 
hear Sirius’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn. 

“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly, “that you and 
Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal 
ending to what should have been a long and happy 
relationship.” 

Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider 
now climbing Dumbledore’s hat. He could tell that 
Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect 
that until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all 
his time at the Dursleys’ lying on his bed, refusing 
meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the 
chill emptiness that he had come to associate with 
dementors. 

“It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to 
realize he won’t write to me again.” 

His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt 
stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had 
someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened 
to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best 
things about discovering his godfather . . . and now the 
post owls would never bring him that comfort again. 



“Sirius represented much to you that you had never 
known before,” said Dumbledore gently. “Naturally, 
the loss is devastating. ...” 



Page | 85 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But while I was at the Dursleys’ ...” interrupted 
Harry, his voice growing stronger, “I realized I can’t 
shut myself away or — or crack up. Sirius wouldn’t 
have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life’s too 
short. ... Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline 
Vance. ... It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is,” 
he said fiercely, now looking straight into 
Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, 

“I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me 
as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.” 

“Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and 
Sirius’s true godson!” said Dumbledore, with an 
approving pat on Harry’s back. “I take my hat off to 
you — or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you 
in spiders. 

“And now, Harry, on a closely related subject ... I 
gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet 
over the last two weeks?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster. 

“Then you will have seen that there have been not so 
much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in 
the Hall of Prophecy?” 

“Yes,” said Harry again. “And now everyone knows 
that I’m the one — ” 

“No, they do not,” interrupted Dumbledore. “There are 
only two people in the whole world who know the full 
contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord 
Voldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly, 
spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many 
have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his 
Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the 
prophecy concerned you. 



Page | 86 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not 
told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?” 

“No,” said Harry. 

“A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. 
“Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your 
friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione 
Granger. Yes,” he continued, when Harry looked 
startled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a 
disservice by not confiding something this important 
to them.” 

“I didn’t want — ” 

“ — to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore, 
surveying Harry over the top of his half-moon 
spectacles. “Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself 
are worried and frightened? You need your friends, 
Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have 
wanted you to shut yourself away.” 

Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to 
require an answer. He continued, “On a different, 
though related, subject, it is my wish that you take 
private lessons with me this year.” 

“Private — with you?” said Harry, surprised out of his 
preoccupied silence. 

“Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in 
your education.” 

“What will you be teaching me, sir?” 

“Oh, a little of this, a little of that,” said Dumbledore 
airily. 



Page | 87 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not 
elaborate, so he asked something else that had been 
bothering him slightly. 

“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do 
Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I?” 

“Professor Snape, Harry — and no, you will not.” 

“Good,” said Harry in relief, “because they were a — ” 

He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought. 

“I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” 
said Dumbledore, nodding. 

Harry laughed. 

“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor 
Snape from now on,” he said, “because he won’t let 
me carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding’ in my 
O.W.L., which I know I haven’t.” 

“Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said 
Dumbledore gravely. “Which, now I think of it, ought 
to be some time later today. Now, two more things, 
Harry, before we part. 

“Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with 
you at all times from this moment onward. Even 
within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand 
me?” 

Harry nodded. 

“And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been 
given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can 
provide. These measures have caused a certain 
amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all 

Page | 88 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




their post, for instance, is being searched at the 
Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in 
the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. 
However, it would be poor repayment if you risked 
your neck while staying with them.” 

“I understand,” said Harry quickly. 

“Very well, then,” said Dumbledore, pushing open the 
broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. “I 
see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly 
any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.” 



Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 







AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 

Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of 
the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar 
litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; 
Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens 
coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked 
three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind 
the kitchen window. 

“Who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as 
Mrs. Weasley’s. “Declare yourself!” 

“It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.” 

The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, 
short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing 
gown. 

“Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, 
you said not to expect you before morning!” 

“We were lucky,” said Dumbledore, ushering Harry 
over the threshold. “Slughorn proved much more 

Page | 90 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



persuadable than I had expected. Harry’s doing, of 
course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!” 

Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was 
not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young 
witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy 
brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large 
mug between her hands. 

“Hello, Professor,” she said. “Wotcher, Harry.” 

“Hi, Tonks.” 

Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there 
was something forced in her smile. Certainly her 
appearance was less colorful than usual without her 
customary shade of bubble-gum-pink hair. 

“I’d better be off,” she said quickly, standing up and 
pulling her cloak around her shoulders. “Thanks for 
the tea and sympathy, Molly.” 

“Please don’t leave on my account,” said Dumbledore 
courteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to 
discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.” 

“No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting 
Dumbledore’s eyes. “ ’Night — ” 

“Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, 

Remus and Mad-Eye are coming — ?” 

“No, really, Molly ... thanks anyway ... Good night, 
everyone.” 

Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the 
yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on 
the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed 
that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled. 

Page | 91 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,” said 
Dumbledore. “Take care of yourself. Molly, your 
servant.” 

He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, 
vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley 
closed the door on the empty yard and then steered 
Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the 
lantern on the table to examine his appearance. 

“You’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and 
down. “Both of you look as though you’ve had 
Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron’s grown 
four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are 
you hungry, Harry?” 

“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, suddenly realizing just how 
hungry he was. 

“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.” 

As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed 
face jumped onto his knees and settled there, 
purring. 

“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled 
Crookshanks behind the ears. 

“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said 
Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. 
It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began 
to bubble at once. “Everyone’s in bed, of course, we 
didn’t expect you for hours. Here you are — ” 

She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew 
toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a 
bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the 
stream of thick, steaming onion soup. 



Page | 92 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Bread, dear?” 



“Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.” 

She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of 
bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as 
the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back 
onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him. 

“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?” 

Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he 
could not speak. 

“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He 
was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same 
time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?” 

His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and 
gave a noncommittal jerk of the head. 

“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. Weasley, nodding 
wisely. “Of course he can be charming when he wants 
to be, but Arthur’s never liked him much. The 
Ministry’s littered with Slughorn’s old favorites, he 
was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had 
much time for Arthur — didn’t seem to think he was 
enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even 
Slughorn makes mistakes. I don’t know whether 
Ron’s told you in any of his letters — it’s only just 
happened — but Arthur’s been promoted!” 

It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had 
been bursting to say this. 

Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and 
thought he could feel his throat blistering. “That’s 
great!” he gasped. 



Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You are sweet,” beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly 
taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. 

“Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices 
in response to the present situation, and Arthur’s 
heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation 
of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. 
It’s a big job, he’s got ten people reporting to him 
now!” 

“What exactly — ?” 

“Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, 
odd things have been cropping up for sale 
everywhere, things that are supposed to guard 
against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You 
can imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective 
potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber 
pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that 
actually make your ears fall off. ... Well, in the main 
the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus 
Fletcher, who’ve never done an honest day’s work in 
their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened 
everybody is, but every now and then something 
really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur 
confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were 
almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you 
see, it’s a very important job, and I tell him it’s just 
silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters 
and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. Weasley 
ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been 
Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark 
plugs. 

“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Harry asked. 

“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. ... 
He said he’d be back around midnight. ...”

She turned to look at a large clock that was perched 
awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing 
basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at 
once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the 
name of a family member, and usually hung on the 
Weasleys’ sitting room wall, though its current 
position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to 
carrying it around the house with her. Every single 
one of its nine hands was now pointing at “mortal 
peril.” 

“It’s been like that for a while now,” said Mrs. 

Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, “ever 
since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I 
suppose everybody’s in mortal danger now. ... I don’t 
think it can be just our family ... but I don’t know 
anyone else who’s got a clock like this, so I can’t 
check. Oh!” 

With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’s 
face. Mr. Weasley’s hand had switched to “traveling.” 

“He’s coming!” 

And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock 
on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and 
hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her 
face pressed against the wood she called softly, 
“Arthur, is that you?” 

“Yes,” came Mr. Weasley’s weary voice. “But I would 
say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the 
question!” 

“Oh, honestly ...” 

“Molly!” 

“All right, all right . . . What is your dearest ambition?” 

Page | 95 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“To find out how airplanes stay up.” 

Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but 
apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the 
other side, because the door remained firmly shut. 

“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!” 

“Arthur, really, this is just silly. ...” 

“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone 
together?” 

Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell 
that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself 
felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and 
hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as 
he could against the bowl. 

“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley 
into the crack at the edge of the door. 

“Correct,” said Mr. Weasley. “Now you can let me in.” 

Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, 
a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn- 
rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling 
cloak. 

“I still don’t see why we have to go through that every 
time you come home,” said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in 
the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. 

“I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer 
out of you before impersonating you!” 

“I know, dear, but it’s Ministry procedure, and I have 
to set an example. Something smells good — onion 
soup?” 



Page | 96 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the 
table. 

“Harry! We didn’t expect you until morning!” 

They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the 
chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup 
in front of him too. 

“Thanks, Molly. It’s been a tough night. Some idiot’s 
started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them 
around your neck and you’ll be able to change your 
appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all 
for ten Galleons!” 

“And what really happens when you put them on?” 

“Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, 
but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike 
warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo’s didn’t 
have enough to do already!” 

“It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George 
would find funny,” said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. “Are 
you sure — ?” 

“Of course I am!” said Mr. Weasley. “The boys 
wouldn’t do anything like that now, not when people 
are desperate for protection!” 

“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?” 

“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in 
Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law 
Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we 
got there. ...” 

Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand. 



Page | 97 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. “I’ve 
got Fred and George’s room all ready for you, you’ll 
have it to yourself.” 

“Why, where are they?” 

“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat 
over their joke shop as they’re so busy,” said Mrs. 
Weasley. “I must say, I didn’t approve at first, but 
they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! 

Come on, dear, your trunk’s already up there.” 

“ ’Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, pushing back his 
chair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and 
slunk out of the room. 

“G’night, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley. 

Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the 
washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands 
were once again at “mortal peril.” 

Fred and George’s bedroom was on the second floor. 
Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the 
bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room 
in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of 
flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the 
small window, their perfume could not disguise the 
lingering smell of what Harry thought was 
gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was 
devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed 
cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry’s school 
trunk. The room looked as though it was being used 
as a temporary warehouse. 

Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top 
of a large wardrobe, then took off through the 
window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him 
before going hunting. Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good 

Page | 98 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. 
There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He 
groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and- 
orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking 
Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was 
instantly asleep. 

Seconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was 
awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the 
door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the 
rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling 
sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. 
Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly 
for his glasses with the other. 

“Wuzzgoinon?” 

“We didn’t know you were here already!” said a loud 
and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the 
top of the head. 

“Ron, don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice reproachfully. 

Harry’s hand found his glasses and he shoved them 
on, though the light was so bright he could hardly see 
anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of 
him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came 
into focus, grinning down at him. 

“All right?” 

“Never been better,” said Harry, rubbing the top of his 
head and slumping back onto his pillows. “You?” 

“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and 
sitting on it. “When did you get here? Mum’s only just 
told us!” 

“About one o’clock this morning.” 

Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?” 

“Same as usual,” said Harry, as Hermione perched 
herself on the edge of his bed, “they didn’t talk to me 
much, but I like it better that way. How’re you, 
Hermione?” 

“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scrutinizing 
Harry as though he was sickening for something. He 
thought he knew what was behind this, and as he 
had no wish to discuss Sirius’s death or any other 
miserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’s the 
time? Have I missed breakfast?” 

“Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a 
tray; she reckons you look underfed,” said Ron, 
rolling his eyes. “So, what’s been going on?” 

“Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and 
uncle’s, haven’t I?” 

“Come off it!” said Ron. “You’ve been off with 
Dumbledore!” 

“It wasn’t that exciting. He just wanted me to help 
him persuade this old teacher to come out of 
retirement. His name’s Horace Slughorn.” 

“Oh,” said Ron, looking disappointed. “We thought — ” 

Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron 
changed tack at top speed. 

“ — we thought it’d be something like that.” 

“You did?” said Harry, amused. 



Page | 100 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah ... yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we 
need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, 
don’t we? So, er, what’s he like?” 

“He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head 
of Slytherin,” said Harry. “Something wrong, 
Hermione?” 

She was watching him as though expecting strange 
symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. 

She rearranged her features hastily in an 
unconvincing smile. 

“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like 
he’ll be a good teacher?” 

“Dunno,” said Harry. “He can’t be worse than 
Umbridge, can he?” 

“I know someone who’s worse than Umbridge,” said a 
voice from the doorway. Ron’s younger sister slouched 
into the room, looking irritable. “Hi, Harry.” 

“What’s up with you?” Ron asked. 

“It’s her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on 
Harry’s bed. “She’s driving me mad.” 

“What’s she done now?” asked Hermione 
sympathetically. 

“It’s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was 
about three!” 

“I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She’s so 
full of herself.” 

Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about 
Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for 

Page | 101 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




saying angrily, “Can’t you two lay off her for five 
seconds?” 

“Oh, that’s right, defend her,” snapped Ginny. “We all 
know you can’t get enough of her.” 

This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s 
mother. Starting to feel that he was missing 
something, Harry said, “Who are you — ?” 

But his question was answered before he could finish 
it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry 
instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so 
hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto 
the floor. 

A young woman was standing in the doorway, a 
woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room 
seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall 
and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to 
emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision 
of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden 
breakfast tray. 

“ ’Arry,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ’as been too 
long!” 

As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. 
Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, 
looking rather cross. 

“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just 
about to do it myself!” 

“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the 
tray across Harry’s knees and then swooping to kiss 
him on each cheek: He felt the places where her 
mouth had touched him burn. “I ’ave been longing to 
see ’im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She 
Page | 102 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




never stops talking about ’Ariy Potter. She will be 
delighted to see you again.” 



“Oh ... is she here too?” Harry croaked. 

“No, no, silly boy,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I 
mean next summer, when we — but do you not 
know?” 

Her great blue eyes widened and she looked 
reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, “We hadn’t 
got around to telling him yet.” 

Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet 
of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the 
face. 

“Bill and I are going to be married!” 

“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing 
how Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all 
determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze. “Wow. Er 
— congratulations!” 

She swooped down upon him and kissed him again. 

“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, 
and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my 
Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get 
to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to ’ear 
you would be coming — zere isn’t much to do ’ere, 
unless you like cooking and chickens! Well — enjoy 
your breakfast, ’Arry!” 

With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to 
float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind 
her. 

Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!” 

Page | 103 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly. 

“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross 
whisper. “I just think they’ve hurried into this 
engagement, that’s all!” 

“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who 
looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed 
door. 

“Well, that’s not very long! I know why it’s happened, 
of course. It’s all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who 
coming back, people think they might be dead 
tomorrow, so they’re rushing all sorts of decisions 
they’d normally take time over. It was the same last 
time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and 
center — ” 

“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly. 

“Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, 
what was the point in waiting?” said Mrs. Weasley. 
“Whereas Bill and Fleur . . . well . . . what have they 
really got in common? He’s a hardworking, down-to- 
earth sort of person, whereas she’s — ” 

“A cow,” said Ginny, nodding. “But Bill’s not that 
down-to-earth. He’s a Curse-Breaker, isn’t he, he 
likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour. ... I expect 
that’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.” 

“Stop calling her that, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley 
sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed. “Well, I’d 
better get on. ... Eat your eggs while they’re warm, 
Harry.” 

Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed 
slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head 



Page | 104 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of 
water. 

“Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same 
house?” Harry asked. 

“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you 
unexpectedly, like then ...” 

“It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away 
from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face 
him with her arms folded once she had reached the 
wall. 

“You don’t really want her around forever?” Ginny 
asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, 
she said, “Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if she 
can, I bet you anything.” 

“How’s she going to manage that?” asked Harry. 

“She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I 
think she’s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I 
hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family.” 

“Yeah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically. “Listen, 
no bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks 
when Fleur’s around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking 
when she isn’t doing stupid things to her hair and her 
nose, but — ” 

“She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm,” said Ginny 

“And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!” said 
Hermione from the corner. 

“Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the 
Triwizard Tournament,” said Harry. 



Page | 105 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly. 



“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry,’ do 
you?” asked Ginny scornfully. 

“No,” said Harry, wishing he hadn’t spoken, “I was 
just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur — ” 

“I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said 
Ginny. “At least she’s a laugh.” 

“She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said Ron. 
“Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like 
Moaning Myrtle.” 

“That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’t 
got over what happened . . . you know ... I mean, he 
was her cousin!” 

Harry’s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He 
picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs 
into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join 
in this part of the conversation. 

“Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron. 
“Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that 
their families never met — ” 

“That’s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it 
was her fault he died!” 

“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry, in 
spite of himself. 

“Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t 
she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her 
off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.” 

“That’s stupid,” said Ron. 

Page | 106 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s survivor’s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’s 
tried to talk her round, but she’s still really down. 
She’s actually having trouble with her 
Metamorphosing! ” 

“With her — ?” 

“She can’t change her appearance like she used to,” 
explained Hermione. “I think her powers must have 
been affected by shock, or something.” 

“I didn’t know that could happen,” said Harry. 

“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re 
really depressed ...” 

The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her 
head in. “Ginny,” she whispered, “come downstairs 
and help me with the lunch.” 

“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny, outraged. 

“Now!” said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew. 

“She only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be 
alone with Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly. She swung 
her long red hair around in a very good imitation of 
Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms 
held aloft like a ballerina. 

“You lot had better come down quickly too,” she said 
as she left. 

Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat 
more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and 
George’s boxes, though every now and then she cast 
sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping 
himself to Harry’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at 
the door. 

Page | 107 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up 
what looked like a small telescope. 

“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George’ve left it 
here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so 
be careful.” 

“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. 
“Said Fred and George have got a real flair for 
business.” 

“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking 
in the Galleons! I can’t wait to see the place, we 
haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says 
Dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been 
really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.” 

“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third- 
eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of 
the family. “Is he talking to your mum and dad 
again?” 

“Nope,” said Ron. 

“But he knows your dad was right all along now 
about Voldemort being back — ” 

“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive 
others for being wrong than being right,” said 
Hermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.” 

“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore 
would say,” said Ron. 

“He’s going to be giving me private lessons this year,” 
said Harry conversationally. 

Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped. 



Page | 108 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You kept that quiet!” said Ron. 

“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly. “He 
told me last night in your broom shed.” 

“Blimey ... private lessons with Dumbledore!” said 
Ron, looking impressed. “I wonder why he’s ... ?” 

His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione 
exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, 
his heart beating rather fast considering that all he 
was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to 
do it. ... Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, 
which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his 
lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to 
be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because 
of the prophecy.” 

Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the 
impression that both had frozen. He continued, still 
speaking to his fork, “You know, the one they were 
trying to steal at the Ministry.” 

“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione 
quickly. “It got smashed.” 

“Although the Prophet says — ” began Ron, but 
Hermione said, “Shh!” 

“The Prophet’s got it right,” said Harry, looking up at 
them both with a great effort: Hermione seemed 
frightened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that 
smashed wasn’t the only record of the prophecy. I 
heard the whole thing in Dumbledore ’s office, he was 
the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell 
me. From what it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it 
looks like I’m the one who’s got to finish off 
Voldemort. ... At least, it said neither of us could live 
while the other survives.” 

Page | 109 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The three of them gazed at one another in silence for 
a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione 
vanished behind a puff of black smoke. 

“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast 
tray slid to the floor with a crash. 

Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, 
clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly 
purple black eye. 

“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped. 

And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long 
spring protruding from the end of the telescope. 

“Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to 
laugh, “Mumll fix that, she’s good at healing minor 
injuries — ” 

“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione 
hastily. “Harry, oh, Harry ...” 

She sat down on the edge of his bed again. 

“We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry ... 
Obviously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but 
from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, 
how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we 
thought it might be something like this. ... Oh, Harry 
...” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you 
scared?” 

“Not as much as I was,” said Harry. “When I first 
heard it, I was . . . but now, it seems as though I 
always knew I’d have to face him in the end. ...” 

“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in 
person, we thought he might be telling you something 

Page | 110 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




or showing you something to do with the prophecy,” 
said Ron eagerly. “And we were kind of right, weren’t 
we? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought 
you were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time — he must 
think you’ve got a chance!” 

“That’s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll 
teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, 
probably ... powerful countercurses ... anti-jinxes ...” 

Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading 
through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; 
a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be 
dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were 
more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere 
fact that they were still there on either side of him, 
speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking 
from him as though he were contaminated or 
dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell 
them. 

"... and evasive enchantments generally,” concluded 
Hermione. “Well, at least you know one lesson you’ll 
be having this year, that’s one more than Ron and 
me. I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come?” 

“Can’t be long now, it’s been a month,” said Ron. 

“Hang on,” said Harry, as another part of last night’s 
conversation came back to him. “I think Dumbledore 
said our O.W.L. results would be arriving today!” 

“Today?” shrieked Hermione. “Today? But why didn’t 
you — oh my God — you should have said — ” 

She leapt to her feet. 

“I’m going to see whether any owls have come. ...” 



Page | 111 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, 
fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it 
was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in 
great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her 
resemblance to half a panda. 

“It just won’t budge,” Mrs. Weasley was saying 
anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in 
her hand and a copy of The Healer’s Helpmate open at 
“Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always 
worked before, I just can’t understand it.” 

“It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, 
making sure it can’t come off,” said Ginny 

“But it’s got to come off!” squeaked Hermione. “I can’t 
go around looking like this forever!” 

“You won’t, dear, we’ll find an antidote, don’t worry,” 
said Mrs. Weasley soothingly. 

“Bill told me ’ow Fred and George are very amusing!” 
said Fleur, smiling serenely. 

“Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped 
Hermione. 

She jumped up and started walking round and round 
the kitchen, twisting her fingers together. 

“Mrs. Weasley, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have 
arrived this morning?” 

“Yes, dear, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. Weasley 
patiently. “But it’s barely nine, there’s still plenty of 
time. ...” 

“I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered 
Hermione feverishly, “I definitely made at least one 

Page | 112 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the 
Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought 
Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking 
back — ” 

“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one 
who’s nervous!” barked Ron. “And when you’ve got 
your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L.s ...” 

“Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said Hermione, flapping her 
hands hysterically. “I know I’ve failed everything!” 

“What happens if we fail?” Harry asked the room at 
large, but it was again Hermione who answered. 

“We discuss our options with our Head of House, I 
asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.” 

Harry’s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten 
less breakfast. 

“At Beauxbatons,” said Fleur complacently, “we ’ad a 
different way of doing things. I think eet was better. 
We sat our examinations after six years of study, not 
five, and then — ” 

Fleur’s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione 
was pointing through the kitchen window. Three 
black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing 
larger all the time. 

“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely, jumping 
up to join Hermione at the window. 

“And there are three of them,” said Harry, hastening 
to her other side. 

“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified 
whisper. “Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ...” 

Page | 113 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the 
elbows. 



The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three 
handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as 
they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, 
was carrying a large square envelope. 

“Oh no\” squealed Hermione. 

Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the 
kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared 
through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All 
three of them lifted their right legs. 

Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him 
was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied 
it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to 
detach his own results; to his right, Hermione’s 
hands were shaking so much she was making her 
whole owl tremble. 

Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed 
to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and 
unfolded the parchment inside.

Harry read the parchment through several times, his 
breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was 
all right: He had always known that he would fail 
Divination, and he had had no chance of passing 
History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway 
through the examination, but he had passed 
everything else! He ran his finger down the grades ... 
he had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology, 
he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And 
best of all, he had achieved “Outstanding” at Defense 
Against the Dark Arts! 

He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and 
her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted. 

“Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who 
cares about them?” he said happily to Harry. “Here — 
swap — ” 

Harry glanced down Ron’s grades: There were no 
“Outstandings” there. ... 

“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” 
said Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. “We’ve 
done all right, haven’t we?” 

“Well done!” said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron’s 
hair. “Seven O.W.L.s, that’s more than Fred and 
George got together!” 



Page | 115 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Hermione?” said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still 
hadn’t turned around. “How did you do?” 

“I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice. 

“Oh, come off it,” said Ron, striding over to her and 
whipping her results out of her hand. “Yep — nine 
‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at 
Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He looked down at 
her, half-amused, half-exasperated. “You’re actually 
disappointed, aren’t you?” 

Hermione shook her head, but Harry laughed. 

“Well, we’re N.E.W.T. students now!” grinned Ron. 
“Mum, are there any more sausages?” 

Harry looked back down at his results. They were as 
good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny 
twinge of regret. ... This was the end of his ambition 
to become an Auror. He had not secured the required 
Potions grade. He had known all along that he 
wouldn’t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as 
he looked again at that small black E. 

It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death 
Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would 
make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken 
hold of him, and he couldn’t really think of anything 
else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the 
right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy 
a few weeks ago. ... Neither can live while the other 
survives. ... Wouldn’t he be living up to the prophecy, 
and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he 
joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was 
to find and kill Voldemort?

DRACO’S DETOUR 

Harry remained within the confines of the Burrow’s 
garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his 
days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys’ 
orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; 
Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were 
reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating 
triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front 
of him. 

It would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it 
not been for the stories of disappearances, odd 
accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily 
in the Prophet Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley 
brought home news before it even reached the paper. 
To Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure, Harry’s sixteenth 
birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings 
brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was 
looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked 
liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and 
patched than ever. 



Page | 117 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“There have been another couple of dementor 
attacks,” he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him 
a large slice of birthday cake. “And they’ve found Igor 
Karkaroff’s body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark 
had been set over it — well, frankly, I’m surprised he 
stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death 
Eaters; Sirius’s brother, Regulus, only managed a few 
days as far as I can remember.” 

“Yes, well,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, “perhaps we 
should talk about something diff — ” 

“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?” 
asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. 
“The man who ran — ” 

“ — the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry 
interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in 
the pit of his stomach. “He used to give me free ice 
creams. What’s happened to him?” 

“Dragged off, by the look of his place.” 

“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly 
glared at Bill. 

“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow. He 
was a good man, Florean.” 

“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks 
like Ollivander’s gone too.” 

“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled. 

“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. 
No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was 
kidnapped.” 

“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?” 

Page | 118 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But 
Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got 
him it’s not so good for us.” 

The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their 
letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’s 
included a surprise: He had been made Quidditch 
Captain. 

“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried 
Hermione happily. “You can use our special bathroom 
now and everything!” 

“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” 
said Ron, examining the badge with glee. “Harry, this 
is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let me back on 
the team, I suppose, ha ha. ...” 

“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon 
Alley much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed Mrs. 
Weasley, looking down Ron’s booklist. “We’ll go on 
Saturday as long as your father doesn’t have to go 
into work again. I’m not going there without him.” 

“Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know- Who’s going to 
be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?” 
sniggered Ron. 

“Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?” 
said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. “If you think 
security’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and 
I’ll get your things myself — ” 

“No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George’s 
shop!” said Ron hastily. 

“Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, 
before I decide you’re too immature to come with us!” 
said Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all 

Page | 119 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




nine hands of which were still pointing at “mortal 
peril,” and balancing it on top of a pile of just- 
laundered towels. “And that goes for returning to 
Hogwarts as well!” 

Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his 
mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering 
clock into her arms and stormed out of the room. 

“Blimey ... you can’t even make a joke round here 
anymore. ...” 

But Ron was careful not to be flippant about 
Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned 
without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, 
though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who 
would be staying at home with Fleur (much to 
Hermione and Ginny’s pleasure), passed a full money 
bag across the table to Harry. 

“Where’s mine?” demanded Ron at once, his eyes 
wide. 

“That’s already Harry’s, idiot,” said Bill. “I got it out of 
your vault for you, Harry, because it’s taking about 
five hours for the public to get to their gold at the 
moment, the goblins have tightened security so 
much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity 
Probe stuck up his ... Well, trust me, this way’s 
easier.” 

“Thanks, Bill,” said Harry, pocketing his gold. 

“ ’E is always so thoughtful,” purred Fleur adoringly, 
stroking Bill’s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her 
cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his 
cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back. 



Page | 120 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special 
Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden 
once before, was awaiting them in the front yard 
when they emerged from the house, pulling on their 
cloaks. 

“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron 
appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car 
moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur 
waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, 

Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy 
comfort in the wide backseat. 

“Don’t get used to it, it’s only because of Harry,” said 
Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley 
were in front with the Ministry driver; the front 
passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what 
resembled a two-seater sofa. “He’s been given top- 
grade security status. And we’ll be joining up with 
additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.” 

Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his 
shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. 
He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack 
and felt that, if that was good enough for 
Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the 
Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was 
not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak. 

“Here you are, then,” said the driver, a surprisingly 
short while later, speaking for the first time as he 
slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside 
the Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for you, any idea 
how long you 11 be?” 

“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, 
good, he’s here!” 



Page | 121 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the 
window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting 
outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black- 
bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts 
gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming 
at the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the 
startled stares of passing Muggles. 

“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone- 
crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of 
the car. “Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh 
should see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be back in 
the open air — ” 

“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harry, grinning as he 
massaged his ribs. “We didn’t know ‘security’ meant 
you!” 

“I know, jus’ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry 
wanted ter send a bunch o’ Aurors, but Dumbledore 
said I’d do,” said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his 
chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. “Let’s 
get goin’ then — after yeh, Molly, Arthur — ” 

The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’s 
memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, 
wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He 
looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he 
could speak, Hagrid said importantly, “Jus’ passin’ 
through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts 
business, yeh know.” 

Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; 
Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked 
through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard 
at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised 
his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the 
wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a 



Page | 122 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




winding cobbled street. They stepped through the 
entrance and paused, looking around. 

Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering 
window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, 
and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the 
large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted 
over them. Most of these somber purple posters 
carried blown-up versions of the security advice on 
the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over 
the summer, but others bore moving black-and-white 
photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the 
loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front 
of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were 
boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue’s Ice 
Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of 
shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. 
The nearest one, which had been erected outside 
Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, 
had a cardboard sign pinned to its front: 

AMULETS 

Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi 

A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of 
silver symbols on chains at passersby. 

“One for your little girl, madam?” he called at Mrs. 
Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. “Protect her 
pretty neck?” 

“If I were on duty ...” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily 
at the amulet seller. 

“Yes, but don’t go arresting anyone now, dear, we’re 
in a hurry,” said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a 
list. “I think we’d better do Madam Malkin’s first, 
Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ron’s showing 

Page | 123 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




much too much ankle in his school robes, and you 
must need new ones too, Harry, you’ve grown so 
much — come on, everyone — ” 

“Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to 
Madam Malkin’s,” said Mr. Weasley. “Why don’t those 
three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and 
Blotts and get everyone’s schoolbooks?” 

“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly 
torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly 
and the wish to stick together in a pack. “Hagrid, do 
you think — ?” 

“Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said Hagrid 
soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin 
lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but 
allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish 
and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, 
Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam 
Malkin’s. 

Harry noticed that many of the people who passed 
them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. 
Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk 
anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own 
tightly knit groups, moving intently about their 
business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone. 

“Migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,” 
said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkin’s and 
bending down to peer through the window. “I’ll stand 
guard outside, all right?” 

So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop 
together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but 
no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than 
they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack 
of dress robes in spangled green and blue. 

Page | 124 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




"... not a child, in case you haven’t noticed, Mother. I 
am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.” 

There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry 
recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, 
“Now, dear, your mother’s quite right, none of us is 
supposed to go wandering around on our own 
anymore, it’s nothing to do with being a child — ” 

“Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!” 

A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white- 
blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a 
handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with 
pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He 
strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a 
few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray 
eyes narrowed. 

“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a 
Mudblood just walked in,” said Draco Malfoy. 

“I don’t think there’s any need for language like that!” 
said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the 
clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. 
“And I don’t want wands drawn in my shop either!” 
she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had 
shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with 
their wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, 
who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, 
“No, don’t, honestly, it’s not worth it. ...” 

“Yeah, like you’d dare do magic out of school,” 
sneered Malfoy. “Who blacked your eye, Granger? I 
want to send them flowers.” 



Page | 125 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, 
looking over her shoulder for support. “Madam — 
please — ” 

Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes 
rack. 

“Put those away,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron. 

“If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is 
the last thing you ever do.” 

“Really?” said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing 
into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, 
still resembled her sister’s. He was as tall as she was 
now. “Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, 
are you?” 

Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart. 

“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to 
say — wands away, please!” 

But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy 
smiled unpleasantly. 

“I see that being Dumbledore’s favorite has given you 
a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But 
Dumbledore won’t always be there to protect you.” 

Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow ... 
look at that ... he’s not here now! So why not have a 
go? They might be able to find you a double cell in 
Azkaban with your loser of a husband!” 

Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but 
stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly. 

“Don’t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!” 
Malfoy snarled. 

Page | 126 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s all right, Draco,” said Narcissa, restraining him 
with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. “I 
expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I 
am reunited with Lucius.” 

Harry raised his wand higher. 

“Harry, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and 
attempting to push it down by his side. “Think. ... 

You mustn’t. ... You’ll be in such trouble. ...” 

Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, 
then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was 
happening in the hope that it wouldn’t. She bent 
toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry. 

“I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, 
dear, let me just — ” 

“Ouch!” bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. 
“Watch where you’re putting your pins, woman! 
Mother — I don’t think I want these anymore — ” 

He pulled the robes over his head and threw them 
onto the floor at Madam Malkin’s feet. 

“You’re right, Draco,” said Narcissa, with a 
contemptuous glance at Hermione, “now I know the 
kind of scum that shops here. ... We’ll do better at 
Twilfitt and Tatting’s.” 

And with that, the pair of them strode out of the 
shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could 
into Ron on the way out. 

“Well, reallyl” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the 
fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them 
like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust. 



Page | 127 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron’s and 
Harry’s new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard’s 
dress robes instead of witch’s, and when she finally 
bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of 
being glad to see the back of them. 

“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they 
reappeared at his side. 

“Just about,” said Harry. “Did you see the Malfoys?” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned. “Bu’ they wouldn’ 
dare make trouble in the middle o’ Diagon Alley, 
Harry. Don’ worry abou’ them.” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but 
before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable 
notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared, all 
clutching heavy packages of books. 

“Everyone all right?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Got your 
robes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary 
and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George’s — stick 
close, now. ...” 

Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the 
Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying 
Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for 
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. 
Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every 
minute or so, they headed farther along the street in 
search of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop 
run by Fred and George. 

“We really haven’t got too long,” Mrs. Weasley said. 

“So we’ll just have a quick look around and then back 
to the car. We must be close, that’s number ninety- 
two ... ninety-four ...” 



Page | 128 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Whoa,” said Ron, stopping in his tracks. 

Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts 
around them, Fred and George’s windows hit the eye 
like a firework display. Casual passersby were looking 
back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few 
rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a 
halt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly 
full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, 
flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to 
water just looking at it. The right-hand window was 
covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the 
Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters: 

WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT 

YOU-KNOW-WHO? 

YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT 
U-NO-POO— 

THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION 
THAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION! 

Harry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan 
beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley 
gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved 
silently, mouthing the name “U-No-Poo.” 

“They’ll be murdered in their beds!” she whispered. 

“No they won’t!” said Ron, who, like Harry, was 
laughing. “This is brilliant!” 

And he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was 
packed with customers; Harry could not get near the 

Page | 129 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes 
piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes 
that the twins had perfected during their last, 
unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the 
Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one 
battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of 
trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber 
chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most 
expensive beating the unwary user around the head 
and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self- 
Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. 

A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his 
way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted 
ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man 
slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, 
both perched on a box that read: REUSABLE 
HANGMAN — SPELL IT OR HE’LL SWING! 

“ ‘Patented Daydream Charms . . . ’ ” 

Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large 
display near the counter and was reading the 
information on the back of a box bearing a highly 
colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning 
girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. 

“ ‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top- 
quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy 
to fit into the average school lesson and virtually 
undetectable (side effects include vacant expression 
and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens.’ 
You know,” said Hermione, looking up at Harry, “that 
really is extraordinary magic!” 

“For that, Hermione,” said a voice behind them, “you 
can have one for free.” 



Page | 130 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of 
magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his 
flaming hair. 

“How are you, Harry?” They shook hands. “And 
what’s happened to your eye, Hermione?” 

“Your punching telescope,” she said ruefully. 

“Oh blimey, I forgot about those,” said Fred. “Here — ” 

He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to 
her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow 
paste. 

“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone within the 
hour,” said Fred. “We had to find a decent bruise 
remover. We’re testing most of our products on 
ourselves.” 

Hermione looked nervous. “It is safe, isn’t it?” she 
asked. 

“ ’Course it is,” said Fred bracingly. “Come on, Harry, 
I’ll give you a tour.” 

Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste 
and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where 
he saw a stand of card and rope tricks. 

“Muggle magic tricks!” said Fred happily, pointing 
them out. “For freaks like Dad, you know, who love 
Muggle stuff. It’s not a big earner, but we do fairly 
steady business, they’re great novelties. ... Oh, here’s 
George. ...” 

Fred’s twin shook Harry’s hand energetically. 



Page | 131 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, 
that’s where we’re making the real money — pocket 
anything, you, and you’ll pay in more than GalleonsV’ 
he added warningly to a small boy who hastily 
whipped his hand out of the tub labeled EDIBLE 
DARK MARKS — THEY’LL MAKE ANYONE SICK! 

George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle 
tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. 
The packaging on the products lining these shelves 
was more subdued. 

“We’ve just developed this more serious line,” said 
Fred. “Funny how it happened ...” 

“You wouldn’t believe how many people, even people 
who work at the Ministry, can’t do a decent Shield 
Charm,” said George. “ ’Course, they didn’t have you 
teaching them, Harry.” 

“That’s right. ... Well, we thought Shield Hats were a 
bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx 
you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx 
just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five 
hundred for all its support staff! And we’re still 
getting massive orders!” 

“So we’ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, 
Shield Gloves ...” 

"... I mean, they wouldn’t help much against the 
Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes 
or jinxes ...” 

“And then we thought we’d get into the whole area of 
Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it’s such a 
money spinner,” continued George enthusiastically. 
“This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we’re 



Page | 132 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a 
quick escape.” 

“And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the 
shelves, look,” said Fred, pointing at a number of 
weird-looking black horn-type objects that were 
indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. “You just 
drop one surreptitiously and it’ll run off and make a 
nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if 
you need one. 

“Handy,” said Harry, impressed. 

“Here,” said George, catching a couple and throwing 
them to Harry. 

A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head 
around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was 
wearing magenta staff robes. 

“There’s a customer out here looking for a joke 
cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,” she said. 

Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George 
called “Mr. Weasley,” but they took it in their stride. 

“Right you are, Verity, I’m coming,” said George 
promptly. “Harry, you help yourself to anything you 
want, all right? No charge.” 

“I can’t do that!” said Harry, who had already pulled 
out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators. 

“You don’t pay here,” said Fred firmly, waving away 
Harry’s gold. 

“But — ” 



Page | 133 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You gave us our start-up loan, we haven’t forgotten,” 
said George sternly. “Take whatever you like, and just 
remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.” 

George swept off through the curtain to help with the 
customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main 
part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still 
poring over the Patented Daydream Charms. 

“Haven’t you girls found our special WonderWitch 
products yet?” asked Fred. “Follow me, ladies. ...” 

Near the window was an array of violently pink 
products around which a cluster of excited girls was 
giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both 
hung back, looking wary. 

“There you go,” said Fred proudly. “Best range of love 
potions you’ll find anywhere.” 

Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. “Do they work?” 
she asked. 

“Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a 
time depending on the weight of the boy in question 



“ — and the attractiveness of the girl,” said George, 
reappearing suddenly at their side. “But we’re not 
selling them to our sister,” he added, becoming 
suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five 
boys on the go from what we’ve — ” 

“Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said 
Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink 
pot off the shelf. “What’s this?” 

“Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,” said Fred. 
“Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads, but 

Page | 134 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




don’t change the subject. Are you or are you not 
currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?” 

“Yes, I am,” said Ginny. “And last time I looked, he 
was definitely one boy, not five. What are those?” 

She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff 
in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the 
bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. 

“Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Miniature puffskeins, we 
can’t breed them fast enough. So what about Michael 
Corner?” 

“I dumped him, he was a bad loser,” said Ginny, 
putting a finger through the bars of the cage and 
watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. “They’re 
really cute!” 

“They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred. “But 
you’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t 
you?” 

Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. 
There was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face 
that Harry was surprised Fred didn’t recoil. 

“It’s none of your business. And I’ll thank you,” she 
added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at 
George’s elbow, laden with merchandise, “not to tell 
tales about me to these two!” 

“That’s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,” said 
Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron’s arms. 
“Cough up.” 

“I’m your brother!” 



Page | 135 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And that’s our stuff you’re nicking. Three Galleons, 
nine Sickles. I’ll knock off the Knut.” 

“But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!” 

“You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on 
the right shelves.” 

Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude 
hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted 
by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to 
appear. 

“If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fingers 
together,” she said sharply. 

“Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Ginny at once. 
“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley warily. 

“Look, they’re so sweet. ...” 

Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, 
and Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an 
unimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was 
hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys’ 
Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. 
Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the 
window and they lost sight of him. 

“Wonder where his mummy is?” said Harry, frowning. 

“Given her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron. 

“Why, though?” said Hermione. 

Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. 

Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son 
out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a 

Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




real effort to free himself from her clutches. Harry, 
knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason 
could not be innocent. 

He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were 
bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was 
delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked 
playing cards. Fred and George were both helping 
customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was 
standing with his back to them, looking up and down 
the street. 

“Get under here, quick,” said Harry, pulling his 
Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. 

“Oh — I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, looking 
uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley. 

“Come on\” said Ron. 

She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under 
the cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them 
vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and 
George’s products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they 
could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy 
had disappeared just as successfully as they had. 

“He was going in that direction,” murmured Harry as 
quietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid 
would not hear them. “C’mon.” 

They scurried along, peering left and right, through 
shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed 
ahead. 

“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whispered. “Turning left?” 
“Big surprise,” whispered Ron. 

Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into 
Knockturn Alley and out of sight. 



“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Harry, speeding up. 

“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the 
cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much 
more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak 
nowadays. 

“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry impatiently. “Just 
hurry!” 

But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the 
Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered 
into windows as they passed, but none of the shops 
seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed 
it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and 
suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts — or at least, 
to be seen buying them. 

Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch. 

“Ouch!” 

“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s 
ear. 

They had drawn level with the only shop in 
Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin 
and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister 
objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls 
and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to 
them, just visible beyond the very same large black 
cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid 
Malfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of 
Malfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. The 
proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, 



Page | 138 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




stooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a 
curious expression of mingled resentment and fear. 



“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said 
Hermione. 

“We can!” said Ron excitedly. “Hang on — damn — ” 

He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still 
clutching as he fumbled with the largest. 

“Extendable Ears, look!” 

“Fantastic!” said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the 
long, fleshcolored strings and began to feed them 
toward the bottom of the door. “Oh, I hope the door 
isn’t Imperturbable — ” 

“No!” said Ron gleefully. “Listen!” 

They put their heads together and listened intently to 
the ends of the strings, through which Malfoy’s voice 
could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had 
been turned on. 

"... you know how to fix it?” 

“Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he 
was unwilling to commit himself. “I’ll need to see it, 
though. Why don’t you bring it into the shop?” 

“I can’t,” said Malfoy. “It’s got to stay put. I just need 
you to tell me how to do it.” 

Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously. 

“Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very 
difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn’t guarantee 
anything.” 

Page | 139 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No?” said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, 
that Malfoy was sneering. “Perhaps this will make you 
more confident.” 

He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view 
by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled 
sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they 
could see was Borgin, looking very frightened. 

“Tell anyone,” said Malfoy, “and there will be 
retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He’s a family 
friend. He’ll be dropping in from time to time to make 
sure you’re giving the problem your full attention.” 

“There will be no need for — ” 

“I’ll decide that,” said Malfoy. “Well, I’d better be off. 
And don’t forget to keep that one safe, I’ll need it.” 

“Perhaps you’d like to take it now?” 

“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how 
would I look carrying that down the street? Just don’t 
sell it.” 

“Of course not ... sir.” 

Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had 
once seen him give Lucius Malfoy. 

“Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my 
mother, understand?” 

“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Borgin, bowing 
again. 

Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as 
Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased 
with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and 

Page | 140 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their 
knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; 
his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried. 

“What was that about?” whispered Ron, reeling in the 
Extendable Ears. 

“Dunno,” said Harry, thinking hard. “He wants 
something mended . . . and he wants to reserve 
something in there. ... Could you see what he pointed 
at when he said ‘that one’?” 

“No, he was behind that cabinet — ” 

“You two stay here,” whispered Hermione. 

“What are you — ?” 

But Hermione had already ducked out from under the 
cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the 
glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell 
tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears 
back under the door and passed one of the strings to 
Harry. 

“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” Hermione said 
brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a 
suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled 
through the jumble of objects on display. 

“Is this necklace for sale?” she asked, pausing beside 
a glass-fronted case. 

“If you’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,” said 
Mr. Borgin coldly. 

“Oh — er — no, I haven’t got quite that much,” said 
Hermione, walking on. “And ... what about this lovely 
— um — skull?” 

Page | 141 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sixteen Galleons.” 



“So it’s for sale, then? It isn’t being ... kept for 
anyone?” 

Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty 
feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. 
Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too 
because she suddenly threw caution to the winds. 

“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just 
now, Draco Malfoy, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I 
want to get him a birthday present, but if he’s already 
reserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get him 
the same thing, so ... um ...” 

It was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and 
apparently Borgin thought so too. 

“Out,” he said sharply. “Get out!” 

Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried 
to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell 
tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her 
and put up the closed sign. 

“Ah well,” said Ron, throwing the cloak back over 
Hermione. “Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious — 



“Well, next time you can show me how it’s done, 
Master of Mystery!” she snapped. 

Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to 
Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to 
stop so that they could dodge undetected around a 
very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who 
had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, 
Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his 
Page | 142 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




bag, and joined in with the other two when they 
insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasley’s accusations, 
that they had been in the back room all along, and 
that she could not have looked properly.

THE SLUG CLUB 

Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays 
pondering the meaning of Malfoy’s behavior in 
Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the 
satisfied look on Malfoy’s face as he had left the shop. 
Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be 
good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither 
Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about 
Malfoy’s activities as he was; or at least, they seemed 
to get bored of discussing it after a few days. 

“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,” said 
Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the 
windowsill in Fred and George’s room with her feet up 
on one of the cardboard boxes and had only 
grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced 
Rune Translation. “But haven’t we agreed there could 
be a lot of explanations?” 

“Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory,” said Ron 
vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his 



Page | 144 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



broomstick’s bent tail twigs. “Remember that 
shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?” 

“But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep 
that one safe’?” asked Harry for the umpteenth time. 
“That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of 
the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.” 

“You reckon?” said Ron, now trying to scrape some 
dirt off his broom handle. 

“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. When neither Ron nor 
Hermione answered, he said, “Malfoy’s father’s in 
Azkaban. Don’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge?” 

Ron looked up, blinking. 

“Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?” 

“That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, 
frustrated. “But he’s up to something and I think we 
should take it seriously. His father’s a Death Eater 
and — ” 

Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind 
Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had 
just occurred to him. 

“Harry?” said Hermione in an anxious voice. “What’s 
wrong?” 

“Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?” asked Ron 
nervously. 

“He’s a Death Eater,” said Harry slowly. “He’s 
replaced his father as a Death Eater!” 



Page | 145 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. 
“Malfoy? He’s sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know- 
Who would let Malfoy join?” 

“It seems very unlikely, Harry,” said Hermione in a 
repressive sort of voice. “What makes you think — ?” 

“In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he 
yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she 
went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He’s 
been branded with the Dark Mark.” 

Ron and Hermione looked at each other. 

“Well ...” said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced. 

“I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,” 
said Hermione. 

“He showed Borgin something we couldn’t see,” Harry 
pressed on stubbornly. “Something that seriously 
scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it — he was 
showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw 
how seriously Borgin took him!” 

Ron and Hermione exchanged another look. 

“I’m not sure, Harry. ...” 

“Yeah, I still don’t reckon You-Know-Who would let 
Malfoy join. ...” 

Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, 

Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and 
left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for 
days not to leave their washing and packing until the 
last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, 
who was returning to her room carrying a pile of 
freshly laundered clothes. 

Page | 146 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned 
him. “There’s a lot of Phlegm around.” 



“I’ll be careful not to slip in it.” Harry smiled. 

Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to 
find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow 
about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. 
Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, 
looking bad-tempered. 

“... Bill and I ’ave almost decided on only two 
bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet 
togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold 
— pink would of course be ’orrible with Ginny’s ’air — 



“Ah, Harry!” said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across 
Fleur’s monologue. “Good, I wanted to explain about 
the security arrangements for the journey to 
Hogwarts tomorrow. We’ve got Ministry cars again, 
and there will be Aurors waiting at the station — ” 

“Is Tonks going to be there?” asked Harry, handing 
over his Quidditch things. 

“No, I don’t think so, she’s been stationed somewhere 
else from what Arthur said.” 

“She has let ’erself go, zat Tonks,” Fleur mused, 
examining her own stunning reflection in the back of 
a teaspoon. “A big mistake if you ask — ” 

“Yes, thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting 
across Fleur again. “You’d better get on, Harry, I want 
the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don’t have 
the usual last-minute scramble.” 



Page | 147 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And in fact, their departure the following morning was 
smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to 
the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks 
packed; Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed 
in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron’s owl, 
Pigwidgeon; and Ginny’s new purple Pygmy Puff, 
Arnold, in cages. 

“Au revoir, ’Ariy,” said Fleur throatily, kissing him 
good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but 
Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in 
the dust at Fleur’s feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt- 
spattered, he hurried into the car without saying 
good-bye. 

There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at 
King’s Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, 
bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward 
the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, 
marched them into the station without speaking. 

“Quick, quick, through the barrier,” said Mrs. 

Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere 
efficiency. “Harry had better go first, with — ” 

She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who 
nodded briefly, seized Harry’s upper arm, and 
attempted to steer him toward the barrier between 
platforms nine and ten. 

“I can walk, thanks,” said Harry irritably, jerking his 
arm out of the Auror’s grip. He pushed his trolley 
directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent 
companion, and found himself, a second later, 
standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where 
the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam 
over the crowd. 



Page | 148 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within 
seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced 
Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow 
him up the platform, looking for an empty 
compartment. 

“We can’t, Harry,” said Hermione, looking apologetic. 
“Ron and I’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first 
and then patrol the corridors for a bit.” 

“Oh yeah, I forgot,” said Harry. 

“You’d better get straight on the train, all of you, 
you’ve only got a few minutes to go,” said Mrs. 
Weasley, consulting her watch. “Well, have a lovely 
term, Ron. ...” 

“Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?” said Harry, 
making up his mind on the spur of the moment. 

“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly 
surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the 
others nevertheless. 

Harry had thought it through carefully and come to 
the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. 
Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he 
worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best 
position to make further investigations, and secondly, 
because he thought that there was not too much risk 
of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger. 

He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror 
casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they 
moved away. 

“When we were in Diagon Alley,” Harry began, but Mr. 
Weasley forestalled him with a grimace. 



Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and 
Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to 
be in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?” 

“How did you — ?” 

“Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised 
Fred and George.” 

“Er ... yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.” 

“Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.” 

“Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my 
Invisibility Cloak.” 

“Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or 
was it a mere whim?” 

“Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,” said 
Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasley’s look of mingled 
exasperation and amusement. “He’d given his mother 
the slip and I wanted to know why.” 

“Of course you did,” said Mr. Weasley, sounding 
resigned. “Well? Did you find out why?” 

“He went into Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry, “and 
started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help 
him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to 
keep something else for him. He made it sound like it 
was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like 
they were a pair. And ...” 

Harry took a deep breath. 

“There’s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a 
mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I 



Page | 150 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




think he’s been branded with the Dark Mark. I think 
he’s replaced his father as a Death Eater.” 

Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he 
said, “Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would 
allow a sixteen-year-old — ” 

“Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would 
or wouldn’t do?” asked Harry angrily. “Mr. Weasley, 
I’m sorry, but isn’t it worth investigating? If Malfoy 
wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten 
Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something Dark or 
dangerous, isn’t it?” 

“I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley 
slowly. “You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, 
we raided his house. We took away everything that 
might have been dangerous.” 

“I think you missed something,” said Harry 
stubbornly. 

“Well, maybe,” said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell 
that Mr. Weasley was humoring him. 

There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone 
had boarded the train and the doors were closing. 

“You’d better hurry,” said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. 
Weasley cried, “Harry, quickly!” 

He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped 
him load his trunk onto the train. 

“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all 
fixed with Dumbledore, so we’ll see you quite soon,” 
said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry 
slammed the door shut behind him and the train 



Page | 151 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




began to move. “You make sure you look after 
yourself and — ” 



The train was gathering speed. 

“ — be good and — ” 

She was jogging to keep up now. 
stay safe!” 

Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and 
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned 
to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron 
and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects’ 
carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the 
corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way 
toward her, dragging his trunk. 

People stared shamelessly as he approached. They 
even pressed their faces against the windows of their 
compartments to get a look at him. He had expected 
an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he 
would have to endure this term after all the “Chosen 
One” rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not 
enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright 
spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder. 

“Fancy trying to find a compartment?” 

“I can’t, Harry, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny 
brightly. “See you later.” 

“Right,” said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of 
annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair 
dancing behind her; he had become so used to her 
presence over the summer that he had almost 
forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, 
Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked

and looked around: He was surrounded by 
mesmerized girls. 

“Hi, Harry!” said a familiar voice from behind him. 

“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round- 
faced boy struggling toward him. 

“Hello, Harry,” said a girl with long hair and large 
misty eyes, who was just behind Neville. 

“Luna, hi, how are you?” 

“Very well, thank you,” said Luna. She was clutching 
a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front 
announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs 
inside. 

“Quibbler still going strong, then?” asked Harry, who 
felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given 
it an exclusive interview the previous year. 

“Oh yes, circulation’s well up,” said Luna happily. 

“Let’s find seats,” said Harry, and the three of them 
set off along the train through hordes of silently 
staring students. At last they found an empty 
compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully. 

“They’re even staring at us!” said Neville, indicating 
himself and Luna. “Because we’re with you!” 

“They’re staring at you because you were at the 
Ministry too,” said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into 
the luggage rack. “Our little adventure there was all 
over the Daily Prophet, you must’ve seen it.” 

“Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the 
publicity,” said Neville, “but she was really pleased. 

Page | 153 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Says I’m starting to live up to my dad at long last. She 
bought me a new wand, look!” 



He pulled it out and showed it to Harry. 

“Cherry and unicorn hair,” he said proudly. “We think 
it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he 
vanished next day — oi, come back here, Trevor!” 

And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it 
made one of its frequent bids for freedom. 

“Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?” 
asked Luna, who was detaching a pair of psychedelic 
spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler. 

“No point now we’ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?” 
said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head 
against the seat as he emerged from under it. He 
looked most disappointed. 

“I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!” 

“I enjoyed the meetings too,” said Luna serenely. “It 
was like having friends.” 

This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna 
often said and which made Harry feel a squirming 
mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could 
respond, however, there was a disturbance outside 
their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls 
was whispering and giggling together on the other 
side of the glass. 

“You ask him!” 

“No, you!” 

“I’ll do it!” 

Page | 154 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark 
eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed 
her way through the door. 

“Hi, Harry, I’m Romilda, Romilda Vane,” she said 
loudly and confidently. “Why don’t you join us in our 
compartment? You don’t have to sit with them,” she 
added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville’s bottom, 
which was sticking out from under the seat again as 
he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now 
wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the 
look of a demented, multicolored owl. 

“They’re friends of mine,” said Harry coldly. 

“Oh,” said the girl, looking very surprised. “Oh. 

Okay.” 

And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her. 

“People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” 
said Luna, once again displaying her knack for 
embarrassing honesty. 

“You are cool,” said Harry shortly. “None of them was 
at the Ministry. They didn’t fight with me.” 

“That’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed Luna. Then 
she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and 
settled down to read The Quibbler. 

“We didn’t face him, though,” said Neville, emerging 
from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair 
and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. “You did. 
You should hear my gran talk about you. ‘That Harry 
Potter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of 
Magic put together*.’ She’d give anything to have you 
as a grandson. ...” 



Page | 155 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the 
subject to O.W.L. results as soon as he could. While 
Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud 
whether he would be allowed to take a 
Transfiguration N.E.W.T. with only an “Acceptable,” 
Harry watched him without really listening. 

Neville’s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort 
just as much as Harry’s had, but Neville had no idea 
how close he had come to having Harry’s destiny. The 
prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, 
for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had 
chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant. 

Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville 
sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped 
scar and the weight of the prophecy. ... Or would it? 
Would Neville’s mother have died to save him, as Lily 
had died for Harry? Surely she would. ... But what if 
she had been unable to stand between her son and 
Voldemort? Would there then have been no “Chosen 
One” at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and 
a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good- 
bye by his own mother, not Ron’s? 

“You all right, Harry? You look funny,” said Neville. 

Harry started. “Sorry — I — ” 

“Wrackspurt got you?” asked Luna sympathetically, 
peering at Harry through her enormous colored 
spectacles. 

“I — what?” 

“A Wrackspurt ... They’re invisible. They float in 
through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she 
said. “I thought I felt one zooming around in here.” 



Page | 156 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating 
off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught 
each other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of 
Quidditch. 

The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy 
as it had been all summer; they passed through 
stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, 
clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, 
when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, 
that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at 
last. 

“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” 
said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside 
Harry and rubbing his stomach. “Hi, Neville. Hi, 

Luna. Guess what?” he added, turning to Harry. 
“Malfoy’s not doing prefect duty. He’s just sitting in 
his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw 
him when we passed.” 

Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like 
Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his 
power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the 
previous year. 

“What did he do when he saw you?” 

“The usual,” said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a 
rude hand gesture. “Not like him, though, is it? Well 
— that is” — he did the hand gesture again — “but 
why isn’t he out there bullying first years? 

“Dunno,” said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn’t 
this look as though Malfoy had more important things 
on his mind than bullying younger students? 



Page | 157 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,” said 
Hermione. “Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame 
after that.” 



“I don’t think so,” said Harry. “I think he’s — ” 

But before he could expound on his theory, the 
compartment door slid open again and a breathless 
third -year girl stepped inside. 

“I’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom 
and Harry P-Potter,” she faltered, as her eyes met 
Harry’s and she turned scarlet. She was holding out 
two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. 
Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed 
to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the 
compartment. 

“What is it?” Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his. 
“An invitation,” said Harry. 

Harry, 

I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of 
lunch in compartment C. 

Sincerely, 

Professor H. E. F. Slug horn 

“Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked Neville, looking 
perplexedly at his own invitation. 

“New teacher,” said Harry. “Well, I suppose we’ll have 
to go, won’t we?” 

“But what does he want me for?” asked Neville 
nervously, as though he was expecting detention. 

Page | 158 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No idea,” said Harry, which was not entirely true, 
though he had no proof yet that his hunch was 
correct. “Listen,” he added, seized by a sudden brain 
wave, “let’s go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we 
might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what 
he’s up to.” 

This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, 
which were packed with people on the lookout for the 
lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while 
wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in 
his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to 
wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to 
have increased in intensity even since he had last 
walked down the train. Every now and then, students 
would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better 
look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who 
darted into her compartment when she saw Harry 
coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her 
deep in determined conversation with her friend 
Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of 
makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd 
formation of pimples still etched across her face. 
Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on. 

When they reached compartment C, they saw at once 
that they were not Slughorn’s only invitees, although 
judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn’s welcome, 
Harry was the most warmly anticipated. 

“Harry, m’boy!” said Slughorn, jumping up at the 
sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly 
seemed to fill all the remaining space in the 
compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery 
mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the 
golden buttons on his waistcoat. “Good to see you, 
good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!” 



Page | 159 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from 
Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the 
only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. 
Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He 
recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy 
with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there 
were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know 
and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and 
looking as though she was not entirely sure how she 
had got there, Ginny. 

“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked Harry 
and Neville. “Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course — 



Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or 
greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and 
Slytherin students loathed each other on principle. 

“This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you’ve come 
across each other — ? No?” 

McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, 
and Harry and Neville nodded back at him. 

“ — and this is Marcus Belby, I don’t know whether — 
?” 

Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a 
strained smile. 

“ — and this charming young lady tells me she knows 
you!” Slughorn finished. 

Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind 
Slughorn’s back. 

“Well now, this is most pleasant,” said Slughorn 
cozily. “A chance to get to know you all a little better. 

Page | 160 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Here, take a napkin. I’ve packed my own lunch; the 
trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on licorice wands, 
and a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up 
to such things. ... Pheasant, Belby?” 

Belby started and accepted what looked like half a 
cold pheasant. 

“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the 
pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn 
told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket 
of rolls. “Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his 
Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much 
of your uncle, Marcus?” 

Unfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful 
of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he 
swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to 
choke. 

“Anapneo,” said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand 
at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once. 

“Not ... not much of him, no,” gasped Belby, his eyes 
streaming. 

“Well, of course, I daresay he’s busy,” said Slughorn, 
looking questioningly at Belby. “I doubt he invented 
the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard 
work!” 

“I suppose ...” said Belby, who seemed afraid to take 
another bite of pheasant until he was sure that 
Slughorn had finished with him. “Er ... he and my 
dad don’t get on very well, you see, so I don’t really 
know much about ...” 

His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold 
smile and turned to McLaggen instead. 

Page | 161 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, you, Cormac,” said Slughorn, “I happen to 
know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he 
has a rather splendid picture of the two of you 
hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?” 

“Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,” said McLaggen. 
“We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour — 
this was before he became Minister, obviously — ” 

“Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?” beamed 
Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; 
somehow, Belby was missed out. “Now tell me ...” 

It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed 
to have been invited because they were connected to 
somebody well-known or influential — everyone 
except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after 
McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful 
witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, 
she had been married seven times, each of her 
husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds 
of gold). It was Neville’s turn next: This was a very 
uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville’s parents, well- 
known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by 
Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater 
cronies. At the end of Neville’s interview, Harry had 
the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment 
on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his 
parents’ flair. 

“And now,” said Slughorn, shifting massively in his 
seat with the air of a compere introducing his star 
act. “Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely 
scratched the surface when we met over the summer!” 
He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he 
was a particularly large and succulent piece of 
pheasant, then said, “ The Chosen One,’ they’re 
calling you now!” 



Page | 162 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini 
were all staring at him. 



“Of course,” said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, 
“there have been rumors for years. ... I remember 
when — well — after that terrible night — Lily — 
James — and you survived — and the word was that 
you must have powers beyond the ordinary — ” 

Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly 
supposed to indicate amused skepticism. An angry 
voice burst out from behind Slughorn. 

“Yeah, Zabini, because you’re so talented ... at posing. 



“Oh dear!” chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking 
around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around 
Slughorn ’s great belly. “You want to be careful, Blaise! 
I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous 
Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I 
wouldn’t cross her!” 

Zabini merely looked contemptuous. 

“Anyway,” said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. 

“Such rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn’t 
know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to 
print inaccuracies, make mistakes — but there seems 
little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there 
was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you 
were there in the thick of it all!” 

Harry, who could not see any way out of this without 
flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn 
beamed at him. 

“So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so 
fond — you were there, then? But the rest of the 

Page | 163 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




stories — so sensational, of course, one doesn’t know 
quite what to believe — this fabled prophecy, for 
instance — ” 

“We never heard a prophecy,” said Neville, turning 
geranium pink as he said it. 

“That’s right,” said Ginny staunchly. “Neville and I 
were both there too, and all this ‘Chosen One’ rubbish 
is just the Prophet making things up as usual.” 

“You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn 
with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but 
both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging 
smile. 

“Yes . . . well ... it is true that the Prophet often 
exaggerates, of course. ...” Slughorn said, sounding a 
little disappointed. “I remember dear Gwenog telling 
me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the 
Holyhead Harpies) — ” 

He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, 
but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn 
had not finished with him, and that he had not been 
convinced by Neville and Ginny. 

The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about 
illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom 
had been delighted to join what he called the “Slug 
Club” at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but 
couldn’t see how to do so politely. Finally the train 
emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a 
red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in 
the twilight. 

“Good gracious, it’s getting dark already! I didn’t 
notice that they’d lit the lamps! You’d better go and 
change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you 

Page | 164 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. 

Harry, Blaise — any time you’re passing. Same goes 
for you, miss,” he twinkled at Ginny. “Well, off you go, 
off you go!” 

As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, 
Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with 
interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back 
along the train. 

“I’m glad that’s over,” muttered Neville. “Strange man, 
isn’t he?” 

“Yeah, he is a bit,” said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. 
“How come you ended up in there, Ginny?” 

“He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said Ginny. “You 
remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the 
D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened 
at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so 
much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I 
thought I was going to get detention, but he just 
thought it was a really good hex and invited me to 
lunch! Mad, eh?” 

“Better reason for inviting someone than because 
their mother’s famous,” said Harry, scowling at the 
back of Zabini ’s head, “or because their uncle — ” 

But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a 
reckless but potentially wonderful idea. ... In a 
minute’s time, Zabini was going to reenter the 
Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would 
be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody 
except fellow Slytherins. ... If Harry could only enter, 
unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? 
True, there was little of the journey left — Hogsmeade 
Station had to be less than half an hour away, 
judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the 
Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




windows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take 
Harry’s suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to 
prove them. 

“I’ll see you two later,” said Harry under his breath, 
pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over 
himself. 

“But what’re you — ?” asked Neville. 

“Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as 
quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train 
made such caution almost pointless. 

The corridors were almost completely empty now. 
Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to 
change into their school robes and pack up their 
possessions. Though he was as close as he could get 
to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick 
enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini 
opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut 
when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it 
closing. 

“What’s wrong with this thing?” said Zabini angrily as 
he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry’s 
foot. 

Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; 
Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over 
sideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing 
ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt 
onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted 
himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that 
Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing 
all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet 
and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had 
flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible 
moment he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his 
Page | 166 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then 
Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off 
him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking 
ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and 
Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats 
with his head in Pansy Parkinson’s lap. Harry lay 
curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that 
every inch of him remained hidden, and watched 
Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s 
forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone 
would have loved to have been in her place. The 
lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a 
bright light over the scene: Harry could read every 
word of Crabbe’s comic directly below him. 

“So, Zabini,” said Malfoy, “what did Slughorn want?” 

“Just trying to make up to well-connected people,” 
said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle. “Not 
that he managed to find many.” 

This information did not seem to please Malfoy. 

“Who else had he invited?” he demanded. 

“McLaggen from Gryffindor,” said Zabini. 

“Oh yeah, his uncle’s big in the Ministry,” said 
Malfoy. 

“ — someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw — ” 

“Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pansy. 

“ — and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,” 
finished Zabini. 

Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy’s hand 
aside. 

Page | 167 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He invited Longbottom?” 

“Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,” said 
Zabini indifferently. 

“What’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?” 

Zabini shrugged. 

“Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at 
‘the Chosen One,’ ” sneered Malfoy, “but that Weasley 
girl! What’s so special about her?” 

“A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy, watching Malfoy 
out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. “Even 
you think she’s good-looking, don’t you, Blaise, and 
we all know how hard you are to please!” 

“I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her 
whatever she looked like,” said Zabini coldly, and 
Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her 
lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his 
hair. 

“Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste. Maybe he’s going a bit 
senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good 
wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a 
favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn’t heard I’m on 
the train, or — ” 

“I wouldn’t bank on an invitation,” said Zabini. “He 
asked me about Nott’s father when I first arrived. 

They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he 
heard he’d been caught at the Ministry he didn’t look 
happy, and Nott didn’t get an invitation, did he? I 
don’t think Slughorn’s interested in Death Eaters.” 

Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly 
humorless laugh. 

Page | 168 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, who cares what he’s interested in? What is he, 
when you come down to it? Just some stupid 
teacher.” Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. “I mean, I 
might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what’s it 
matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or 
not?” 

“What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts 
next year?” said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming 
Malfoy at once. 

“Well, you never know,” said Malfoy with the ghost of 
a smirk. “I might have — er — moved on to bigger and 
better things.” 

Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry’s 
heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione 
say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at 
Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any 
plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even 
Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his 
haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of 
Malfoy’s hair, looking dumbfounded. 

“Do you mean — Him?” 

Malfoy shrugged. 

“Mother wants me to complete my education, but 
personally, I don’t see it as that important these days. 
I mean, think about it. ... When the Dark Lord takes 
over, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or 
N.E.W.T.s anyone’s got? Of course he isn’t. ... It’ll be 
all about the kind of service he received, the level of 
devotion he was shown.” 

“And you think you’ll be able to do something for 
him?” asked Zabini scathingly. “Sixteen years old and 
not even fully qualified yet?” 

Page | 169 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m 
qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t 
something that you need to be qualified for,” said 
Malfoy quietly. 

Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths 
open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy 
as though she had never seen anything so awe- 
inspiring. 

“I can see Hogwarts,” said Malfoy, clearly relishing the 
effect he had created as he pointed out of the 
blackened window. “We’d better get our robes on.” 

Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice 
Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, 
it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an 
involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the 
luggage rack, frowning. 

Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not 
much like the idea of being discovered hiding under 
his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly 
Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still 
throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to 
disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his 
relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined 
the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, 
locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky 
crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his 
neck. 

Harry could see the corridors filling up again and 
hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things 
out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he 
was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, 
with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. 
Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out 



Page | 170 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; 
Crabbe and Zabini followed. 

“You go on,” Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for 
him with her hand held out as though hoping he 
would hold it. “I just want to check something.” 

Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the 
compartment. People were filing past, descending 
onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the 
compartment door and let down the blinds, so that 
people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He 
then bent down over his trunk and opened it again. 

Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, 
his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy 
wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the 
mysterious broken object it was so important to 
mend? 

“Petrificus Totalusl” 

Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, 
who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow 
motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, 
with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy’s 
feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his 
whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly 
into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn’t move 
a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who 
smiled broadly. 

“I thought so,” he said jubilantly. “I heard Goyle’s 
trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white 
flash through the air after Zabini came back. ...” 

His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry’s trainers.

“You didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter. But 
while I’ve got you here ...” 

And he stamped, hard, on Harry’s face. Harry felt his 
nose break; blood spurted everywhere. 

“That’s from my father. Now, let’s see. ...” 

Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry’s 
immobilized body and threw it over him. 

“I don’t reckon they’ll find you till the train’s back in 
London,” he said quietly. “See you around, Potter ... 
or not.” 

And taking care to tread on Harry’s fingers, Malfoy 
left the compartment.

SNAPE VICTORIOUS 

Harry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath 
the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose 
flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices 
and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate 
thought was that someone, surely, would check the 
compartments before the train departed again. But at 
once came the dispiriting realization that even if 
somebody looked into the compartment, he would be 
neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that 
somebody else would walk in and step on him. 

Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay 
there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood 
dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a 
stupid situation to have landed himself in . . . and now 
the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was 
shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could 
hear the scraping of trunks and the loud babble of 
talk. 



Page | 173 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the 
train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts 
and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and 
down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally 
realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be 
halfway back to London. 

He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was 
impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, 
like Dumbledore, could perform spells without 
speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had 
fallen out of his hand, by saying the words “Accio 
Wand\” over and over again in his head, but nothing 
happened. 

He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees 
that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an 
owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he 
despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked 
voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A 
feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he 
imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages 
trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of 
laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was 
riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on 
Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson. 

The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his 
side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of 
the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to 
vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was 
leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. ... 

Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a 
voice overhead said, “Wotcher, Harry.” 

There was a flash of red light and Harry’s body 
unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more 
dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his 

Page | 174 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




bruised face with the back of his hand, and raise his 
head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the 
Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away. 

“We’d better get out of here, quickly,” she said, as the 
train windows became obscured with steam and they 
began to move out of the station. “Come on, we’ll 
jump.” 

Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled 
open the train door and leapt onto the platform, 
which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the 
train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered 
a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see 
the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, 
round the corner, and disappear from view. 

The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing 
nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and 
embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a 
ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the 
Invisibility Cloak. 

“Who did it?” 

“Draco Malfoy,” said Harry bitterly. “Thanks for ... 
well ...” 

“No problem,” said Tonks, without smiling. From 
what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as 
mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been 
when he had met her at the Burrow. “I can fix your 
nose if you stand still.” 

Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been 
intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in 
whom he had a little more confidence when it came to 
Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he 
stayed stock-still and closed his eyes. 

Page | 175 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Episkey,” said Tonks. 



Harry’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He 
raised a hand and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be 
mended. 

“Thanks a lot!” 

“You’d better put that cloak back on, and we can walk 
up to the school,” said Tonks, still unsmiling. As 
Harry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved 
her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature 
erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. 

“Was that a Patronus?” asked Harry, who had seen 
Dumbledore send messages like this. 

“Yes, I’m sending word to the castle that I’ve got you 
or they’ll worry. Come on, we’d better not dawdle.” 

They set off toward the lane that led to the school. 

“How did you find me?” 

“I noticed you hadn’t left the train and I knew you 
had that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for 
some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn 
down on that compartment I thought I’d check.” 

“But what are you doing here, anyway?” Harry asked. 

“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school 
extra protection,” said Tonks. 

“Is it just you who’s stationed up here, or — ?” 

“No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.” 

“Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?” 

Page | 176 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s right.” 



They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the 
freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways 
at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been 
inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at 
times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. 
Now she seemed older and much more serious and 
purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had 
happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably 
that Hermione would have suggested he say 
something consoling about Sirius to her, that it 
hadn’t been her fault at all, but he couldn’t bring 
himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for 
Sirius’s death; it was no more her fault than anyone 
else’s (and much less than his), but he did not like 
talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they 
tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks ’s 
long cloak whispering on the ground behind them. 

Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had 
never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was 
from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally 
saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each 
topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was 
hungry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, 
gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to 
push open the gates, he found them chained shut. 

“Alohomora\” he said confidently, pointing his wand at 
the padlock, but nothing happened. 

“That won’t work on these,” said Tonks. “Dumbledore 
bewitched them himself.” 

Harry looked around. 

“I could climb a wall,” he suggested. 



Page | 177 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, you couldn’t,” said Tonks flatly. “Anti-intruder 
jinxes on all of them. Security’s been tightened a 
hundredfold this summer.” 

“Well then,” said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her 
lack of helpfulness, “I suppose I’ll just have to sleep 
out here and wait for morning.” 

“Someone’s coming down for you,” said Tonks. “Look.” 

A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the 
castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could 
even endure Filch’s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness 
and rants about how his timekeeping would improve 
with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was 
not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away 
from them, and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility 
Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, 
with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose 
and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape. 

“Well, well, well,” sneered Snape, taking out his wand 
and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains 
snaked backward and the gates creaked open. “Nice 
of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently 
decided that the wearing of school robes would 
detract from your appearance.” 

“I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my — ” Harry began, 
but Snape cut across him. 

“There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite 
— ah — safe in my hands.” 

“I meant Hagrid to get the message,” said Tonks, 
frowning. 

“Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like 
Potter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally,” 

Page | 178 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, 
“I was interested to see your new Patronus.” 

He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and 
tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they 
slithered, clinking, back into place. 

“I think you were better off with the old one,” said 
Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable. “The 
new one looks weak.” 

As Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, 
fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks’s face. 
Then she was covered in darkness once more. 

“Good night,” Harry called to her over his shoulder, as 
he began the walk up to the school with Snape. 
“Thanks for ... everything.” 

“See you, Harry.” 

Snape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as 
though his body was generating waves of hatred so 
powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could 
not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape 
from their first encounter, but Snape had placed 
himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility 
of Harry’s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. 
Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to 
think over the summer, and had concluded that 
Snape ’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining 
safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the 
Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably 
been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the 
Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to 
this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, 
which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if 
anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the 
man now striding next to him in the darkness. 

Page | 179 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,” 
said Snape. “And, let me see, another twenty for your 
Muggle attire. You know, I don’t believe any House 
has ever been in negative figures this early in the 
term: We haven’t even started pudding. You might 
have set a record, Potter.” 

The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to 
blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been 
immobilized all the way back to London than tell 
Snape why he was late. 

“I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did 
you?” Snape continued. “And with no flying car 
available you decided that bursting into the Great 
Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a 
dramatic effect.” 

Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his 
chest might explode. He knew that Snape had come 
to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he 
could needle and torment Harry without anyone else 
listening. 

They reached the castle steps at last and as the great 
oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged 
entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of 
tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the 
doors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry 
wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak 
back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long 
Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the 
farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. 
As though he had read Harry’s mind, however, Snape 
said, “No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees 
you, which is what you wanted, I’m sure.” 

Harry turned on the spot and marched straight 
through the open doors: anything to get away from 

Page | 180 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Snape. The Great Hall, with its four long House tables 
and its staff table set at the top of the room, was 
decorated as usual with floating candles that made 
the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a 
shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so 
fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before 
people really started to stare, and by the time they 
were standing up to get a good look at him, he had 
spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches 
toward them, and forced his way in between them. 

“Where’ve you — blimey, what’ve you done to your 
face?” said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone 
else in the vicinity. 

“Why, what’s wrong with it?” said Harry, grabbing a 
spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection. 

“You’re covered in blood!” said Hermione. “Come here 



She raised her wand, said “Tergeol” and siphoned off 
the dried blood. 

“Thanks,” said Harry, feeling his now clean face. 
“How’s my nose looking?” 

“Normal,” said Hermione anxiously. “Why shouldn’t 
it? Harry, what happened? We’ve been terrified!” 

“I’ll tell you later,” said Harry curtly. He was very 
conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus 
were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the 
Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench 
to eavesdrop. 

“But — ” said Hermione. 



Page | 181 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Not now, Hermione,” said Harry, in a darkly 
significant voice. He hoped very much that they would 
all assume he had been involved in something heroic, 
preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a 
dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story 
as far and wide as he could, but there was always a 
chance it wouldn’t reach too many Gryffindor ears. 

He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs 
and a handful of chips, but before he could take them 
they vanished, to be replaced with puddings. 

“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said Hermione, as 
Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau. 

“Hat say anything interesting?” asked Harry, taking a 
piece of treacle tart. 

“More of the same, really ... advising us all to unite in 
the face of our enemies, you know.” 

“Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?” 

“Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for 
after the feast, doesn’t he? It can’t be long now.” 

“Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast — ” 

“You’ve seen Snape? How come?” said Ron between 
frenzied mouthfuls of gateau. 

“Bumped into him,” said Harry evasively. 

“Hagrid was only a few minutes late,” said Hermione. 
“Look, he’s waving at you, Harry.” 

Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at 
Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had 
never quite managed to comport himself with the 

Page | 182 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor 
House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere 
between Hagrid’s elbow and shoulder as they were 
sitting side by side, and who was looking 
disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry 
was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor 
Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid’s other side; she rarely 
left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the 
start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, 
glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes 
magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having 
always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had 
been shocked to discover at the end of the previous 
term that it had been she who had made the 
prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry’s 
parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge had 
made him even less eager to find himself in her 
company, but thankfully, this year he would be 
dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes 
swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away 
toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming 
the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and 
applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, 
his insides burning again. What he would not give to 
fight Malfoy one-on-one . . . 

“So what did Professor Slughorn want?” Hermione 
asked. 

“To know what really happened at the Ministry,” said 
Harry. 

“Him and everyone else here,” sniffed Hermione. 
“People were interrogating us about it on the train, 
weren’t they, Ron?” 

“Yeah,” said Ron. “All wanting to know if you really 
are ‘the Chosen One’ — ” 



Page | 183 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“There has been much talk on that very subject even 
amongst the ghosts,” interrupted Nearly Headless 
Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward 
Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. “I am 
considered something of a Potter authority; it is 
widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the 
spirit community that I will not pester you for 
information, however. ‘Harry Potter knows that he 
can confide in me with complete confidence/ I told 
them. ‘I would rather die than betray his trust.’ ” 

“That’s not saying much, seeing as you’re already 
dead,” Ron observed. 

“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt 
axe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, 
and he rose into the air and glided back toward the 
far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got 
to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter 
echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly. 

“The very best of evenings to you!” he said, smiling 
broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace 
the whole room. 

“What happened to his hand?” gasped Hermione. 

She was not the only one who had noticed. 
Dumbledore ’s right hand was as blackened and dead- 
looking as it had been on the night he had come to 
fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers swept the 
room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, 
merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve 
over his injury. 

“Nothing to worry about,” he said airily. “Now ... to 
our new students, welcome, to our old students, 
welcome back! Another year full of magical education 
awaits you ...” 

Page | 184 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“His hand was like that when I saw him over the 
summer,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I thought 
he’d have cured it by now, though ... or Madam 
Pomfrey would’ve done.” 

“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a 
nauseated expression. “But there are some injuries 
you can’t cure ... old curses ... and there are poisons 
without antidotes. ...” 

"... and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say 
that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought 
at the shop called Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. 

“Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch 
teams should give their names to their Heads of 
House as usual. We are also looking for new 
Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise. 

“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff 
this year. Professor Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, 
his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big 
waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow 
— “is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to 
resume his old post of Potions master.” 

“Potions?” 

“Potions?” 

The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered 
whether they had heard right. 

“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning 
to stare at Harry. “But you said — ” 

“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, 
raising his voice so that it carried over all the 



Page | 185 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense 
Against the Dark Arts teacher.” 



“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in 
his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at 
the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given 
the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this 
time? Hadn’t it been widely known for years that 
Dumbledore did not trust him to do it? 

“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be 
teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!” said 
Hermione. 

“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to 
remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but 
now that he came to think of it, he was unable to 
recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn 
would be teaching. 

Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did 
not stand up at the mention of his name; he merely 
raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause 
from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could 
detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so 
much. 

“Well, there’s one good thing,” he said savagely. 

“Snape ’ll be gone by the end of the year.” 

“What do you mean?” asked Ron. 

“That job’s jinxed. No one’s lasted more than a year. 

... Quirrell actually died doing it. ... Personally, I’m 
going to keep my fingers crossed for another death. 



“Harry!” said Hermione, shocked and reproachful. 

Page | 186 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end 
of the year,” said Ron reasonably. “That Slughorn 
bloke might not want to stay long-term. Moody 
didn’t.” 

Dumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione were not the only ones who had been 
talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of 
conversation at the news that Snape had finally 
achieved his heart’s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the 
sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, 
Dumbledore said nothing more about staff 
appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure 
that the silence was absolute before continuing. 

“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord 
Voldemort and his followers are once more at large 
and gaining in strength.” 

The silence seemed to tauten and strain as 
Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy 
was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork 
hover in midair with his wand, as though he found 
the headmaster’s words unworthy of his attention. 

“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous 
the present situation is, and how much care each of 
us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain 
safe. The castle’s magical fortifications have been 
strengthened over the summer, we are protected in 
new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard 
scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any 
student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to 
abide by any security restrictions that your teachers 
might impose upon you, however irksome you might 
find them — in particular, the rule that you are not to 
be out of bed after hours. I implore you, should you 
notice anything strange or suspicious within or 
outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff 
Page | 187 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, 
always, with the utmost regard for your own and 
others’ safety.” 

Dumbledore’s blue eyes swept over the students 
before he smiled once more. 

“But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable 
as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top 
priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. 
Let us therefore say good night. Pip pip!” 

With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches 
were moved back and the hundreds of students began 
to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. 
Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the 
gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to 
allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, 
lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his 
trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw 
ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill 
her prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but 
Ron remained with Harry. 

“What really happened to your nose?” he asked, once 
they were at the very back of the throng pressing out 
of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else. 

Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their 
friendship that Ron did not laugh. 

“I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,” 
he said darkly. 

“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry bitterly. 
“Listen to what he was saying before he found out I 
was there. ...” 



Page | 188 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoy’s 
boasts. With what Harry considered pure 
pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed. 

“Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for 
Parkinson. ... What kind of mission would You-Know- 
Who have given him?” 

“How d’you know Voldemort doesn’t need someone at 
Hogwarts? It wouldn’t be the first — ” 

“I wish yeh’d stop sayin’ tha’ name, Harry,” said a 
reproachful voice behind them. Harry looked over his 
shoulder to see Hagrid shaking his head. 

“Dumbledore uses that name,” said Harry stubbornly. 

“Yeah, well, tha’s Dumbledore, innit?” said Hagrid 
mysteriously. “So how come yeh were late, Harry? I 
was worried.” 

“Got held up on the train,” said Harry. “Why were you 
late?” 

“I was with Grawp,” said Hagrid happily. “Los’ track o’ 
the time. He’s got a new home up in the mountains 
now, Dumbledore fixed it — nice big cave. He’s much 
happier than he was in the forest. We were havin’ a 
good chat.” 

“Really?” said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron’s 
eye; the last time he had met Hagrid’s half-brother, a 
vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the 
roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of 
which he was unable to pronounce properly. 

“Oh yeah, he’s really come on,” said Hagrid proudly. 
“Yeh’ll be amazed. I’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’ him up as 
me assistant.” 

Page | 189 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a 
violent sneeze. They were now standing beside the 
oak front doors. 

“Anyway, I’ll see yeh tomorrow, firs’ lesson’s straight 
after lunch. Come early an’ yeh can say hello ter Buck 
— I mean, Witherwings!” 

Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of 
the front doors into the darkness. 

Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell 
that Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as 
himself. 

“You’re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are 
you?” 

Ron shook his head. “And you’re not either, are you?” 

Harry shook his head too. 

“And Hermione,” said Ron, “she’s not, is she?” 

Harry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid 
would say when he realized his three favorite 
students had given up his subject, he did not like to 
think.

THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE 

Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room 
before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some 
support for his theory, Harry lost no time in telling 
Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on 
the Hogwarts Express. 

“But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, 
wasn’t he?” interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione 
could say anything. 

“Well,” she said uncertainly, “I don’t know. ... It would 
be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important 
than he is ... but that’s a big lie to tell. ...” 

“Exactly,” said Harry, but he could not press the 
point, because so many people were trying to listen in 
to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and 
whispering behind their hands. 

“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a particularly 
minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to 
climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been 

Page | 191 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



muttering something about Harry behind his hand to 
his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of 
the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. 

“I love being a sixth year. And we’re going to be 
getting free time this year. Whole periods when we 
can just sit up here and relax.” 

“We’re going to need that time for studying, Ron!” said 
Hermione, as they set off down the corridor. 

“Yeah, but not today,” said Ron. “Today’s going to be 
a real doss, I reckon.” 

“Hold it!” said Hermione, throwing out an arm and 
halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to 
push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly 
in his hand. “Fanged Frisbees are banned, hand it 
over,” she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed 
over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and 
took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to 
vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione ’s grip. 

“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.” 

Hermione ’s remonstration was drowned by a loud 
giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron’s 
remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as 
she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her 
shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself. 

The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and 
streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares 
of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. 
While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, 
Harry and Ron told Hermione about their 
embarrassing conversation with Hagrid the previous 
evening. 



Page | 192 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But he can’t really think we’d continue Care of 
Magical Creatures!” she said, looking distressed. “I 
mean, when has any of us expressed ... you know ... 
any enthusiasm?” 

“That’s it, though, innit?” said Ron, swallowing an 
entire fried egg whole. “We were the ones who made 
the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But 
he thinks we liked the stupid subject D’you reckon 
anyone’s going to go on to N.E.W.T.?” 

Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no 
need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their 
year would want to continue Care of Magical 
Creatures. They avoided Hagrid’s eye and returned 
his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the 
staff table ten minutes later. 

After they had eaten, they remained in their places, 
awaiting Professor McGonagall’s descent from the 
staff table. The distribution of class schedules was 
more complicated than usual this year, for Professor 
McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody 
had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue 
with their chosen N.E.W.T.s. 

Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with 
Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, 
Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient 
Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-period 
Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took 
a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious 
as Professor McGonagall looked down his application 
and then consulted his O.W.L. results. 

“Herbology, fine,” she said. “Professor Sprout will be 
delighted to see you back with an ‘Outstanding’ 

O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark 
Arts with ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ But the problem is 

Page | 193 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Transfiguration. I’m sorry, Longbottom, but an 
Acceptable’ really isn’t good enough to continue to 
N.E.W.T level. I just don’t think you’d be able to cope 
with the coursework.” 

Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered 
at him through her square spectacles. 

“Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, 
anyway? I’ve never had the impression that you 
particularly enjoyed it.” 

Neville looked miserable and muttered something 
about “my grandmother wants.” 

“Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall. “It’s high time 
your grandmother learned to be proud of the 
grandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks 
she ought to have — particularly after what happened 
at the Ministry.” 

Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; 
Professor McGonagall had never paid him a 
compliment before. 

“I’m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my 
N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an ‘Exceeds 
Expectations’ in Charms, however — why not try for a 
N.E.W.T. in Charms?” 

“My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,” 
mumbled Neville. 

“Take Charms,” said Professor McGonagall, “and I 
shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just 
because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is 
not necessarily worthless.” Smiling slightly at the look 
of delighted incredulity on Neville’s face, Professor 
McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of 
Page | 194 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his 
new classes, to Neville. 

Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, 
whose first question was whether Firenze, the 
handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination. 

“He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes 
between them this year,” said Professor McGonagall, 
a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common 
knowledge that she despised the subject of 
Divination. “The sixth year is being taken by Professor 
Trelawney.” 

Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking 
slightly crestfallen. 

“So, Potter, Potter ...” said Professor McGonagall, 
consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. 

“Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, 
Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased 
with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. 
Now, why haven’t you applied to continue with 
Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an 
Auror?” 

“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ 
in my O.W.L., Professor.” 

“And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching 
the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly 
happy to accept N.E.W.T students with ‘Exceeds 
Expectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with 
Potions?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn’t buy the books or any 
ingredients or anything — ” 



Page | 195 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you 
some,” said Professor McGonagall. “Very well, Potter, 
here is your schedule. Oh, by the way — twenty 
hopefuls have already put down their names for the 
Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you 
in due course and you can fix up trials at your 
leisure.” 

A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same 
subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table 
together. 

“Look,” said Ron delightedly, gazing at his schedule, 
“we’ve got a free period now ... and a free period after 
break ... and after lunch ... excellent.” 

They returned to the common room, which was empty 
apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie 
Bell, the only remaining member of the original 
Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in 
his first year. 

“I thought you’d get that, well done,” she called over, 
pointing at the Captain’s badge on Harry’s chest. “Tell 
me when you call trials!” 

“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, “you don’t need to try 
out, I’ve watched you play for five years. ...” 

“You mustn’t start off like that,” she said warningly. 
“For all you know, there’s someone much better than 
me out there. Good teams have been ruined before 
now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, 
or letting in their friends. ...” 

Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing 
with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the 
fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common 
room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the 

Page | 196 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




tapestry. Crookshanks’s yellow eyes followed it and he 
hissed when it came too close. 

An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common 
room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom 
four floors below. Hermione was already queuing 
outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and 
looking put-upon. 

“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said 
anxiously, when Harry and Ron joined her. “A fifteen- 
inch essay, two translations, and I’ve got to read 
these by Wednesday!” 

“Shame,” yawned Ron. 

“You wait,” she said resentfully. “I bet Snape gives us 
loads.” 

The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape 
stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as 
ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell 
over the queue immediately. 

“Inside,” he said. 

Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had 
imposed his personality upon the room already; it 
was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn 
over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New 
pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing 
people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly 
injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody 
spoke as they settled down, looking around at the 
shadowy, gruesome pictures. 

“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said 
Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class 
from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her 

Page | 197 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag 
and stowed it under her chair. “I wish to speak to 
you, and I want your fullest attention.” 

His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, 
lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry’s 
than anyone else’s. 

“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I 
believe.” 

You believe ... like you haven’t watched them all come 
and go, Snape, hoping you’d be next, thought Harry 
scathingly. 

“Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own 
methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am 
surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this 
subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you 
manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will 
be much more advanced.” 

Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking 
now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to 
keep him in view. 

“The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, varied, ever- 
changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a 
many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is 
severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than 
before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, 
mutating, indestructible.” 

Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to 
respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another 
to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving 
caress in his voice? 



Page | 198 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must 
therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you 
seek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a few of 
them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of 
what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the 
Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand toward a witch 
who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the 
Dementor’s Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and 
blank-eyed, slumped against a wall — “or provoke the 
aggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the 
ground. 

“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil 
in a high-pitched voice. “Is it definite, is he using 
them?” 

“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said 
Snape, “which means you would be well-advised to 
assume he might use them again. Now ...” 

He set off again around the other side of the 
classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched 
him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind 
him. 

"... you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of 
nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a 
nonverbal spell?” 

Hermione’s hand shot into the air. Snape took his 
time looking around at everybody else, making sure 
he had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very well — 
Miss Granger?” 

“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of 
magic you’re about to perform,” said Hermione, 

“which gives you a split-second advantage.” 



Page | 199 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“An answer copied almost word for word from The 
Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,” said Snape 
dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), 
“but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress to 
using magic without shouting incantations gain an 
element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all 
wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of 
concentration and mind power which some” — his 
gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more — 
“lack.” 

Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous 
Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused 
to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape 
looked away. 

“You will now divide,” Snape went on, “into pairs. One 
partner will attempt to jinx the other without 
speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in 
equal silence. Carry on.” 

Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at 
least half the class (everyone who had been a member 
of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the 
previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm 
without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of 
cheating ensued; many people were merely 
whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. 
Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione 
managed to repel Neville’s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx 
without uttering a single word, a feat that would 
surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor 
from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, 
but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as 
they practiced, looking just as much like an 
overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and 
Ron struggling with the task. 



Page | 200 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was 
purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save 
himself from the temptation of muttering the 
incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on 
tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever 
to come. 

“Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. “Here 
— let me show you — ” 

He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry 
reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells 
forgotten, he yelled, “Protegol” 

His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked 
off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had 
looked around and now watched as Snape righted 
himself, scowling. 

“Do you remember me telling you we are practicing 
nonverbal spells, Potter?” 

“Yes,” said Harry stiffly. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“There’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ Professor.” 

The words had escaped him before he knew what he 
was saying. Several people gasped, including 
Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and 
Seamus grinned appreciatively. 

“Detention, Saturday night, my office,” said Snape. “I 
do not take cheek from anyone, Potter ... not even ‘the 
Chosen One. ’ ” 

“That was brilliant, Harry!” chortled Ron, once they 
were safely on their way to break a short while later. 

Page | 201 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, 
frowning at Ron. “What made you?” 



“He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed 
Harry. “I had enough of that during those 
Occlumency lessons! Why doesn’t he use another 
guinea pig for a change? What’s Dumbledore playing 
at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear 
him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All 
that unfixed, indestructible stuff — ” 

“Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit 
like you.” 

“Like me?” 

“Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face 
Voldemort. You said it wasn’t just memorizing a 
bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your 
brains and your guts — well, wasn’t that what Snape 
was saying? That it really comes down to being brave 
and quick-thinking?” 

Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his 
words as well worth memorizing as The Standard 
Book of Spells that he did not argue. 

“Harry! Hey, Harry!” 

Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters 
on last year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was 
hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment. 

“For you,” panted Sloper. “Listen, I heard you’re the 
new Captain. When’re you holding trials?” 

“I’m not sure yet,” said Harry, thinking privately that 
Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. 
“I’ll let you know.” 

Page | 202 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, right. I was hoping it’d be this weekend — ” 



But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized 
the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving 
Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron 
and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went. 

Dear Harry, 

I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. 
Kindly come along to my office at 8 p.m. I hope you are 
enjoying your first day back at school. 

Yours sincerely, 

Albus Dumbledore 

P. S. I enjoy Acid Pops. 

“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the 
message over Harry’s shoulder and was looking 
perplexed. 

“It’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his 
study,” said Harry in a low voice. “Ha! Snape’s not 
going to be pleased. ... I won’t be able to do his 
detention!” 

He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break 
speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. 
Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes 
and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not 
know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and 
thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted 
to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After 
break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and 
Ron returned to the common room, where they 
grudgingly started Snape’s homework. This turned 
out to be so complex that they still had not finished 
Page | 203 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free 
period (though she considerably speeded up the 
process). They had only just finished when the bell 
rang for the afternoon’s double Potions and they beat 
the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that 
had, for so long, been Snape’s. 

When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there 
were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. 
level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve 
the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had 
made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws 
were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, 
whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous 
manner. 

“Harry,” Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand 
as Harry approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in 
Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning. Good 
lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of 
course, for us old D.A. lags ... And how are you, Ron 
— Hermione?” 

Before they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon 
door opened and Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of 
the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus 
mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he 
greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm. 

The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of 
vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling 
cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, 
as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the 
one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting 
one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever 
inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of 
treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, 
Page | 204 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and something flowery he thought he might have 
smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was 
breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion’s 
fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great 
contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, 
who grinned back lazily. 

“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, 
whose massive outline was quivering through the 
many shimmering vapors. “Scales out, everyone, and 
potion kits, and don’t forget your copies of Advanced 
Potion-Making. ...” 

“Sir?” said Harry, raising his hand. 

“Harry, m’boy?” 

“I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s 
Ron — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the 
N.E.W.T., you see — ” 

“Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention ... not to 
worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use 
ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I’m 
sure we can lend you some scales, and we’ve got a 
small stock of old books here, they’ll do until you can 
write to Flourish and Blotts. ...” 

Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after 
a moment’s foraging, emerged with two very battered- 
looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius 
Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with 
two sets of tarnished scales. 

“Now then,” said Slughorn, returning to the front of 
the class and inflating his already bulging chest so 
that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst 
off, “I’ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look 
at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind 
Page | 205 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




of thing you ought to be able to make after completing 
your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ’em, even 
if you haven’t made ’em yet. Anyone tell me what this 
one is?” 

He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. 
Harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what 
looked like plain water boiling away inside it. 

Hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before 
anybody else’s; Slughorn pointed at her. 

“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that 
forces the drinker to tell the truth,” said Hermione. 

“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” 
he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the 
Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty well known. 
... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too ... Who 
can — ?” 

Hermione’s hand was fastest once more. 

“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said. 

Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike 
substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent 
Hermione getting the credit for answering the 
question; she, after all, was the one who had 
succeeded in making it, back in their second year. 

“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here ... yes, my 
dear?” said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, 
as Hermione’s hand punched the air again. 

“It’s Amortentia!” 



Page | 206 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said 
Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, “but I 
assume you know what it does?” 

“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said 
Hermione. 

“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its 
distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?” 

“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said 
Hermione enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to 
smell differently to each of us, according to what 
attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and 
new parchment and — ” 

But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the 
sentence. 

“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, 
ignoring Hermione’s embarrassment. 

“Hermione Granger, sir.” 

“Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to 
Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most 
Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?” 

“No, I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see.” 

Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper 
something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn 
showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and 
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next 
to her. 

“Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and 
she’s the best in our yeah’ I’m assuming this is the 
very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?” 

Page | 207 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, sir,” said Harry. 



“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for 
Gryffindor, Miss Granger,” said Slughorn genially. 

Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time 
Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione 
turned to Harry with a radiant expression and 
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the 
year? Oh, Harry!” 

“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered 
Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. “You are 
the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if he’d asked 
me!” 

Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that 
they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron 
looked slightly disgruntled. 

“Amortentia doesn’t really create love, of course. It is 
impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this 
will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. 
It is probably the most dangerous and powerful 
potion in this room — oh yes,” he said, nodding 
gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were 
smirking skeptically. “When you have seen as much 
of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power 
of obsessive love. ... 

“And now,” said Slughorn, “it is time for us to start 
work.” 

“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said 
Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron 
standing on Slughorn ’s desk. The potion within was 
splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten 
gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above 
the surface, though not a particle had spilled. 

Page | 208 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that 
Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had 
waited to be asked for dramatic effect. “Yes. That. 
Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most 
curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he 
turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out 
an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis 
does, Miss Granger?” 

“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes 
you lucky!” 

The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. 
Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his 
sleek blond head, because he was at last giving 
Slughorn his full and undivided attention. 

“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. 
Yes, it’s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,” said 
Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and 
disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, 
as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors 
tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.” 

“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said 
Terry Boot eagerly. 

“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, 
recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,” said 
Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you know ... 
highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, 
and very occasionally ...” 

“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner 
with great interest. 

“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was 
twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two 



Page | 209 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect 
days.” 

He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was 
playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good. 

“And that,” said Slughorn, apparently coming back to 
earth, “is what I shall be offering as a prize in this 
lesson.” 

There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of 
the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold. 

“One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn, taking 
a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his 
pocket and showing it to them all. “Enough for twelve 
hours’ luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in 
everything you attempt. 

“Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a 
banned substance in organized competitions . . . 
sporting events, for instance, examinations, or 
elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary 
day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes 
extraordinary! 

“So,” said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, “how are you to 
win my fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of 
Advanced Potion-Making. We have a little over an hour 
left to us, which should be time for you to make a 
decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know 
it is more complex than anything you have attempted 
before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from 
anybody. The person who does best, however, will win 
little Felix here. Off you go!” 

There was a scraping as everyone drew their 
cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as 
people began adding weights to their scales, but 

Page | 210 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was 
almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly 
through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. It could 
not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that 
lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book 
Slughorn had lent him. 

To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had 
scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were 
as black as the printed portions. Bending low to 
decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous 
owner had made annotations and crossed things out) 
Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find 
what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, 
he saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he 
could. 

Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the 
class was doing; this was both an advantage and a 
disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your 
work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place 
was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed 
to have progressed furthest. Her potion already 
resembled the “smooth, black currant-colored liquid” 
mentioned as the ideal halfway stage. 

Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low 
over his book again. It was really very irritating, 
having to try and decipher the directions under all the 
stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some 
reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the 
sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative 
instruction: 

Crush with flat side of silver dagger, 
releases juice better than cutting. 



Page | 211 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas 
Malfoy?” 

Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the 
Slytherin table. 

“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, “I 
was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it 
wasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at his age. ...” 

And he walked away. Harry bent back over his 
cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had 
expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps 
even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type 
he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as 
though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but 
talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis. 

The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to 
cut up. Harry turned to Hermione. 

“Can I borrow your silver knife?” 

She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her 
potion, which was still deep purple, though according 
to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac 
by now. 

Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the 
dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded 
so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean 
could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the 
cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion 
immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac 
described by the textbook. 

His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on 
the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of 
instructions. According to the book, he had to stir 

Page | 212 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as 
water. According to the addition the previous owner 
had made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir 
after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the 
old owner be right twice? 

Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and 
stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The 
potion turned palest pink. 

“How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who 
was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier 
and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her 
potion was still resolutely purple. 

“Add a clockwise stir — ” 

“No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she 
snapped. 

Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. 
Seven stirs counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause ... 
seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise ... 

Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his 
breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry 
glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else’s 
potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, 
something that had certainly never happened before 
in this dungeon. 

“And time’s ... up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, 
please!” 

Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into 
cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally 
gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached 
the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie 
were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike 
Page | 213 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over Ernie’s 
navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an 
approving nod. Then he saw Harry’s, and a look of 
incredulous delight spread over his face. 

“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. 

“Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it’s clear 
you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab 
hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here 
you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and 
use it well!” 

Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his 
inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at 
the furious looks on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at 
the disappointed expression on Hermione’s. Ron 
looked simply dumbfounded. 

“How did you do that?” he whispered to Harry as they 
left the dungeon. 

“Got lucky, I suppose,” said Harry, because Malfoy 
was within earshot. 

Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor 
table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell 
them. Hermione’s face became stonier with every 
word he uttered. 

“I s’pose you think I cheated?” he finished, aggravated 
by her expression. 

“Well, it wasn’t exactly your own work, was it?” she 
said stiffly. 

“He only followed different instructions to ours,” said 
Ron. “Could’ve been a catastrophe, couldn’t it? But he 
took a risk and it paid off.” He heaved a sigh. 
“Slughorn could’ve handed me that book, but no, I get 

Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the one no one’s ever written on. Puked on, by the 
look of page fifty-two, but — ” 

“Hang on,” said a voice close by Harry’s left ear and 
he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had 
picked up in Slughorn’s dungeon. He looked around 
and saw that Ginny had joined them. “Did I hear 
right? You’ve been taking orders from something 
someone wrote in a book, Harry?” 

She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was 
on her mind at once. 

“It’s nothing,” he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. 
“It’s not like, you know, Riddle’s diary. It’s just an old 
textbook someone’s scribbled on.” 

“But you’re doing what it says?” 

“I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, 
honestly, Ginny, there’s nothing funny — ” 

“Ginny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at 
once. “We ought to check that there’s nothing odd 
about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who 
knows?” 

“Hey!” said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy 
of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised 
her wand. 

“ Specialis Revelio\” she said, rapping it smartly on the 
front cover. 

Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay 
there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. 

“Finished?” said Harry irritably. “Or d’you want to 
wait and see if it does a few backflips?” 

Page | 215 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the 
book suspiciously. “I mean, it really does seem to be 
... just a textbook.” 

“Good. Then I’ll have it back,” said Harry, snatching it 
off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed 
open on the floor. 

Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve 
the book, and as he did so, he saw something 
scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the 
same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions 
that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now 
safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk 
upstairs. 

This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.

THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 

For the rest of the week’s Potions lessons Harry 
continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince’s 
instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius 
Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson 
Slughorn was raving about Harry’s abilities, saying 
that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither 
Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although 
Harry had offered to share his book with both of 
them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the 
handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep 
asking Harry to read aloud or it might look 
suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely 
plowing on with what she called the “official” 
instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered 
as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s. 

Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince 
had been. Although the amount of homework they 
had been given prevented him from reading the whole 
of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had 
skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was 

Page | 217 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




barely a page on which the Prince had not made 
additional notes, not all of them concerned with 
potion-making. Here and there were directions for 
what looked like spells that the Prince had made up 
himself. 

“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing 
Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the 
common room on Saturday evening. “It might have 
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a 
girl’s than a boy’s.” 

“The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,” Harry said. 
“How many girls have been Princes?” 

Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She 
merely scowled and twitched her essay on The 
Principles of Re materialization away from Ron, who 
was trying to read it upside down. 

Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old 
copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. 

“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for 
Dumbledore.” 

“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good 
luck! We’ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches 
you!” 

“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them 
watched Harry leave through the portrait hole. 

Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though 
he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor 
Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to 
herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing 
cards, reading them as she walked. 



Page | 218 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Two of spades: conflict,” she murmured, as she 
passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. 
“Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. 
Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly 
troubled, one who dislikes the questioner — ” 

She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry’s 
statue. 

“Well, that can’t be right,” she said, annoyed, and 
Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off 
again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry 
behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she 
had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the 
spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single 
gargoyle stood against the wall. 

“Acid Pops,” said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; 
the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral 
stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry 
stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up 
to the door with the brass knocker that led to 
Dumbledore’s office. 

Harry knocked. 

“Come in,” said Dumbledore’s voice. 

“Good evening, sir,” said Harry, walking into the 
headmaster’s office. 

“Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,” said 
Dumbledore, smiling. “I hope you’ve had an enjoyable 
first week back at school?” 

“Yes, thanks, sir,” said Harry. 

“You must have been busy, a detention under your 
belt already!” 

Page | 219 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Er,” began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did 
not look too stern. 

“I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will 
do your detention next Saturday instead.” 

“Right,” said Harry, who had more pressing matters 
on his mind than S nape’s detention, and now looked 
around surreptitiously for some indication of what 
Dumbledore was planning to do with him this 
evening. The circular office looked just as it always 
did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle- 
legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of 
previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in 
their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, 
Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching 
Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as 
though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling 
practice. 

“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. 
“You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have 
planned for you during these — for want of a better 
word — lessons?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you 
know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill 
you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain 
information.” 

There was a pause. 

“You said, at the end of last term, you were going to 
tell me everything,” said Harry. It was hard to keep a 
note of accusation from his voice. “Sir,” he added. 



Page | 220 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And so I did,” said Dumbledore placidly. “I told you 
everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be 
leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying 
together through the murky marshes of memory into 
thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, 

Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey 
Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese 
cauldron.” 

“But you think you’re right?” said Harry. 

“Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I 
make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being — 
forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my 
mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” 

“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “does what you’re going 
to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will 
it help me . . . survive?” 

“It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said 
Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him 
about the next day’s weather, “and I certainly hope 
that it will help you to survive.” 

Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the 
desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to 
watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside 
the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was 
holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with 
odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve 
on the desk in front of Harry. 

“You look worried.” 

Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some 
apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd 
device that stored and revealed thoughts and 
memories, though highly instructive, had also been 

Page | 221 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its 
contents, he had seen much more than he would 
have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling. 

“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me ... and, 
even more unusually, with permission.” 

“Where are we going, sir?” 

“For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said 
Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle 
containing a swirling silvery- white substance. 

“Who was Bob Ogden?” 

“He was employed by the Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement,” said Dumbledore. “He died some time 
ago, but not before I had tracked him down and 
persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. 

We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in 
the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry ...” 

But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the 
stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed 
stiff and painful. 

“Shall — shall I, sir?” 

“No matter, Harry — ” 

Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the 
cork flew out. 

“Sir — how did you injure your hand?” Harry asked 
again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture 
of revulsion and pity. 

“Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. 
We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.” 

Page | 222 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle 
into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, 
neither liquid nor gas. 

“After you,” said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the 
bowl. 

Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged 
his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet 
leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through 
whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was 
blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had 
adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. 

They were standing in a country lane bordered by 
high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as 
bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in 
front of them stood a short, plump man wearing 
enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to 
molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost 
that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand 
side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he 
was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing 
the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by 
inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in 
this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one- 
piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do 
more than register his bizarre appearance, however, 
Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. 

Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the 
wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The 
one pointing back the way they had come read: 

GREAT HANGLETON, 5 MILES. The arm pointing 
after Ogden said LITTLE HANGLETON, 1 MILE. 

They walked a short way with nothing to see but the 
hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the 
swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane 

Page | 223 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down 
a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected 
view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry 
could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, 
nestled between two steep hills, its church and 
graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the 
opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house 
surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. 

Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the 
steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his 
stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought 
Little Hangleton must be their final destination and 
wondered, as he had done on the night they had 
found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from 
such a distance. He soon discovered that he was 
mistaken in thinking that they were going to the 
village, however. The lane curved to the right and 
when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very 
edge of Ogden’s frock coat vanishing through a gap in 
the hedge. 

Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow 
dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows 
than those they had left behind. The path was 
crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like 
the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch 
of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the 
track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore 
and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had 
stopped and drawn his wand. 

Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast 
deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds 
before Harry’s eyes discerned the building half-hidden 
amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very 
strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd 
decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking 
all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered 
Page | 224 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so 
many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were 
visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips 
reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with 
grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could 
possibly live there, however, one of the windows was 
thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam 
or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was 
cooking. 

Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, 
rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees 
slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front 
door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. 

Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in 
rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his 
feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so 
fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and 
stumbled. 

“ You’re not welcome.” 

The man standing before them had thick hair so 
matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several 
of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and 
dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have 
looked comical, but he did not; the effect was 
frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for 
backing away several more paces before he spoke. 

“Er — good morning. I’m from the Ministry of Magic 



“ You’re not welcome.” 

“Er — I’m sorry — I don’t understand you,” said 
Ogden nervously. 



Page | 225 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the 
stranger was making himself very clear in Harry’s 
opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in 
one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the 
other. 

“You understand him, I’m sure, Harry?” said 
Dumbledore quietly. 

“Yes, of course,” said Harry, slightly nonplussed. 

“Why can’t Ogden — ?” 

But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door 
again, he suddenly understood. 

“He’s speaking Parseltongue?” 

“Very good,” said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. 

The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife 
in one hand, wand in the other. 

“Now, look — ” Ogden began, but too late: There was a 
bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his 
nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from 
between his fingers. 

“Morfin!” said a loud voice. 

An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, 
banging the door behind him so that the dead snake 
swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the 
first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very 
broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright 
brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, 
gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He 
came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who 
was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden 
on the ground. 

Page | 226 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Ministry, is it?” said the older man, looking down at 
Ogden. 

“Correct!” said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. “And 
you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?” 

“S’right,” said Gaunt. “Got you in the face, did he?” 

“Yes, he did!” snapped Ogden. 

“Should’ve made your presence known, shouldn’t 
you?” said Gaunt aggressively. “This is private 
property. Can’t just walk in here and not expect my 
son to defend himself.” 

“Defend himself against what, man?” said Ogden, 
clambering back to his feet. 

“Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.” 

Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was 
still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow 
pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke 
out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. 

“Get in the house. Don’t argue.” 

This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; 
even while he could understand what was being said, 
he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all 
Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point 
of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a 
threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering 
away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and 
slamming the front door behind him, so that the 
snake swung sadly again. 



Page | 227 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s your son I’m here to see, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, 
as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his 
coat. “That was Morfin, wasn’t it?” 

“Ar, that was Morfin,” said the old man indifferently. 
“Are you pure-blood?” he asked, suddenly aggressive. 

“That’s neither here nor there,” said Ogden coldly, 
and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently 
Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden’s 
face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to 
be an offensive tone, “Now I come to think about it, 

I’ve seen noses like yours down in the village.” 

“I don’t doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,” 
said Ogden. “Perhaps we could continue this 
discussion inside?” 

“Inside?” 

“Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I’ve already told you. I’m here about 
Morfin. We sent an owl — ” 

“I’ve no use for owls,” said Gaunt. “I don’t open 
letters.” 

“Then you can hardly complain that you get no 
warning of visitors,” said Ogden tartly. “I am here 
following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which 
occurred here in the early hours of this morning — ” 

“All right, all right, all right!” bellowed Gaunt. “Come 
in the bleeding house, then, and much good it’ll do 
you!” 

The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two 
doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen 
and living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a 
filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live 

Page | 228 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at 
it in Parseltongue: 

Hissy, hissy, little snakey, 

Slither on the floor, 

You be good to Morfin 
Or hell nail you to the door. 

There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the 
open window, and Harry realized that there was 
somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray 
dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall 
behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot 
on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with 
the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. 
Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, 
rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother’s, stared 
in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than 
the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a 
more defeated-looking person. 

“M’daughter, Merope,” said Gaunt grudgingly, as 
Ogden looked inquiringly toward her. 

“Good morning,” said Ogden. 

She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at 
her father turned her back on the room and 
continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. 

“Well, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, “to get straight to the 
point, we have reason to believe that your son, 

Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last 
night.” 

There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped 
one of the pots. 



Page | 229 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Pick it up\” Gaunt bellowed at her. “That’s it, grub on 
the floor like some filthy Muggle, what’s your wand 
for, you useless sack of muck?” 

“Mr. Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, 
as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, 
flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot 
again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, 
pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible 
spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor 
away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in 
two. 

Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt 
screamed, “Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!” 

Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had 
time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and 
said firmly, “Reparo.” The pot mended itself instantly. 

Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to 
shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: 
Instead, he jeered at his daughter, “Lucky the nice 
man from the Ministry’s here, isn’t it? Perhaps he’ll 
take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn’t mind dirty 
Squibs. ...” 

Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, 
Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands 
trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her 
back against the wall between the filthy window and 
the stove, as though she wished for nothing more 
than to sink into the stone and vanish. 

“Mr. Gaunt,” Ogden began again, “as I’ve said: the 
reason for my visit — ” 



Page | 230 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I heard you the first time!” snapped Gaunt. “And so 
what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming 
to him — what about it, then?” 

“Morfin has broken Wizarding law,” said Ogden 
sternly. 

“ ‘Morfin has broken Wizarding law.’ ” Gaunt imitated 
Ogden’s voice, making it pompous and singsong. 
Morfin cackled again. “He taught a filthy Muggle a 
lesson, that’s illegal now, is it?” 

“Yes,” said Ogden. “I’m afraid it is.” 

He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of 
parchment and unrolled it. 

“What’s that, then, his sentence?” said Gaunt, his 
voice rising angrily. 

“It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing — ” 

“Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, 
summoning my son anywhere?” 

“I’m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,” 
said Ogden. 

“And you think we’re scum, do you?” screamed 
Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow- 
nailed finger pointing at his chest. “Scum who’ll come 
running when the Ministry tells ’em to? Do you know 
who you’re talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do 
you? 

“I was under the impression that I was speaking to 
Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, looking wary, but standing 
his ground. 



Page | 231 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s right!” roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry 
thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, 
but then realized that he was showing Ogden the 
ugly, black- stoned ring he was wearing on his middle 
finger, waving it before Ogden’s eyes. “See this? See 
this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? 
Centuries it’s been in our family, that’s how far back 
we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much 
I’ve been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of 
arms engraved on the stone?” 

“I’ve really no idea,” said Ogden, blinking as the ring 
sailed within an inch of his nose, “and it’s quite 
beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed 



With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. 
For a split second, Harry thought he was going to 
throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next 
moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold 
chain around her neck. 

“See this?” he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy 
gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and 
gasped for breath. 

“I see it, I see it!” said Ogden hastily. 

“Slytherin’sl” yelled Gaunt. “Salazar Slytherin’s! We’re 
his last living descendants, what do you say to that, 
eh?” 

“Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!” said Ogden in alarm, but 
Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered 
away from him, back to her corner, massaging her 
neck and gulping for air. 

“So!” said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just 
proved a complicated point beyond all possible 

Page | 232 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




dispute. “Don’t you go talking to us as if we’re dirt on 
your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all — 
more than you can say, I don’t doubt!” 

And he spat on the floor at Ogden’s feet. Morfin 
cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, 
her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, 
said nothing. 

“Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden doggedly, “I am afraid that 
neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do 
with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, 
Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. 

Our information” — he glanced down at his scroll of 
parchment — “is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex 
on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly 
painful hives.” 

Morfin giggled. 

“ Be quiet, boy,” snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and 
Morfin fell silent again. 

“And so what if he did, then?” Gaunt said defiantly to 
Ogden. “I expect you’ve wiped the Muggle ’s filthy face 
clean for him, and his memory to boot — ” 

“That’s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?” said 
Ogden. “This was an unprovoked attack on a 
defenseless — ” 

“Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the 
moment I saw you,” sneered Gaunt, and he spat on 
the floor again. 

“This discussion is getting us nowhere,” said Ogden 
firmly. “It is clear from your son’s attitude that he 
feels no remorse for his actions.” He glanced down at 
his scroll of parchment again. “Morfin will attend a 

Page | 233 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the 
charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and 
causing harm and distress to that same Mugg — ” 

Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of 
horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in 
through the open window. Apparently the winding 
lane to the village passed very close to the copse 
where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his 
eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward 
the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her 
head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white. 

“My God, what an eyesore!” rang out a girl’s voice, as 
clearly audible through the open window as if she had 
stood in the room beside them. “Couldn’t your father 
have that hovel cleared away, Tom?” 

“It’s not ours,” said a young man’s voice. “Everything 
on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that 
cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his 
children. The son’s quite mad, you should hear some 
of the stories they tell in the village — ” 

The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were 
growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of 
his armchair. 

“Keep your seat,” said his father warningly, in 
Parseltongue. 

“Tom,” said the girl’s voice again, now so close they 
were clearly right beside the house, “I might be wrong 
— but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?” 

“Good lord, you’re right!” said the man’s voice. “That’ll 
be the son, I told you he’s not right in the head. Don’t 
look at it, Cecilia, darling.” 



Page | 234 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing 
fainter again. 

“ ‘Darling,’ ” whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, 
looking at his sister. “ ‘Darling,’ he called her. So he 
wouldn’t have you anyway.” 

Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to 
faint. 

“What’s that?” said Gaunt sharply, also in 
Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. 

“ What did you say, Morfin?” 

“She likes looking at that Muggle,” said Morfin, a 
vicious expression on his face as he stared at his 
sister, who now looked terrified. “Always in the 
garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at 
him, isn’t she? And last night — ” 

Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but 
Morfin went on ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the 
window waiting for him to ride home, wasn’t she?” 

“Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said 
Gaunt quietly. 

All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten 
Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated 
at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing 
and rasping. 

“Is it true?” said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a 
step or two toward the terrified girl. “My daughter — 
pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin — 
hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?” 

Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself 
into the wall, apparently unable to speak. 

Page | 235 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But I got him, FatheA” cackled Morfin. “I got him as 
he went by and he didn’t look so pretty with hives all 
over him, did he, Merope?” 

“You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood 
traitoA.” roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands 
closed around his daughter’s throat. 

Both Harry and Ogden yelled “No!” at the same time; 
Ogden raised his wand and cried, “Relashiol” Gaunt 
was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he 
tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a 
roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at 
Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes 
indiscriminately from his wand. 

Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they 
ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope ’s screams 
echoing in his ears. 

Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main 
lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with 
the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, 
dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl 
riding beside him on a gray horse roared with 
laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the 
horse’s flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, 
covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell 
up the lane. 

“I think that will do, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He 
took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, 
they were both soaring weightlessly through 
darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, 
back in Dumbledore ’s now twilit office. 

“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said Harry 
at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of 
his wand. “Merope, or whatever her name was?” 

Page | 236 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, she survived,” said Dumbledore, reseating 
himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry 
should sit down too. “Ogden Apparated back to the 
Ministry and returned with reinforcements within 
fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to 
fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the 
cottage, and subsequently convicted by the 
Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of 
Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in 
Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry 
employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.” 

“Marvolo?” Harry repeated wonderingly. 

“That’s right,” said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. 

“I am glad to see you’re keeping up.” 

“That old man was — ?” 

“Voldemort’s grandfather, yes,” said Dumbledore. 
“Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, 
were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding 
family noted for a vein of instability and violence that 
flourished through the generations due to their habit 
of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled 
with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family 
gold was squandered several generations before 
Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor 
and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic 
amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of 
family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as 
his son, and rather more than his daughter.” 

“So Merope,” said Harry, leaning forward in his chair 
and staring at Dumbledore, “so Merope was ... Sir, 
does that mean she was ... Voldemort’s mother?” 



Page | 237 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It does,” said Dumbledore. “And it so happens that 
we also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s father. I wonder 
whether you noticed?” 

“The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the 
horse?” 

“Very good indeed,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Yes, 
that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle 
who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for 
whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning 
passion.” 

“And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, 
unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. 

“I think you are forgetting,” said Dumbledore, “that 
Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical 
powers appeared to their best advantage when she 
was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and 
Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone 
and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, 
she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to 
plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for 
eighteen years. 

“Can you not think of any measure Merope could 
have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle 
companion, and fall in love with her instead?” 

“The Imperius Curse?” Harry suggested. “Or a love 
potion?” 

“Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she 
used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed 
more romantic to her, and I do not think it would 
have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle 
was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of 
water. In any case, within a few months of the scene 
Page | 238 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton 
enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the 
gossip it caused when the squire’s son ran off with 
the tramp’s daughter, Merope. 

“But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s. He 
returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his 
daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal 
ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of 
dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she 
had done. 

“From all that I have been able to discover, he never 
mentioned her name or existence from that time 
forth. The shock of her desertion may have 
contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had 
simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had 
greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see 
Morfin return to the cottage.” 

“And Merope? She ... she died, didn’t she? Wasn’t 
Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?” 

“Yes, indeed,” said Dumbledore. “We must do a 
certain amount of guessing here, although I do not 
think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, 
within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom 
Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little 
Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around 
the neighborhood that he was talking of being 
‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’ What he meant, I am 
sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that 
had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use 
those precise words for fear of being thought insane. 
When they heard what he was saying, however, the 
villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, 
pretending that she was going to have his baby, and 
that he had married her for this reason.” 



Page | 239 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But she did have his baby.” 



“But not until a year after they were married. Tom 
Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.” 

“What went wrong?” asked Harry. “Why did the love 
potion stop working?” 

“Again, this is guesswork,” said Dumbledore, “but I 
believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her 
husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by 
magical means. I believe that she made the choice to 
stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she 
was, she had convinced herself that he would by now 
have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she 
thought he would stay for the baby’s sake. If so, she 
was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her 
again, and never troubled to discover what became of 
his son.” 

The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in 
Dumbledore ’s office seemed to glow more brightly 
than before. 

“I think that will do for tonight, Harry,” said 
Dumbledore after a moment or two. 

“Yes, sir,” said Harry. 

He got to his feet, but did not leave. 

“Sir ... is it important to know all this about 
Voldemort’s past?” 

“Very important, I think,” said Dumbledore. 

“And it ... it’s got something to do with the prophecy?” 

“It has everything to do with the prophecy.” 

Page | 240 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Right,” said Harry, a little confused, but reassured 
all the same. 

He turned to go, then another question occurred to 
him, and he turned back again. “Sir, am I allowed to 
tell Ron and Hermione everything you’ve told me?” 

Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, 
“Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have 
proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going 
to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to 
anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got 
around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord 
Voldemort’s secrets.” 

“No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione. 
Good night.” 

He turned away again, and was almost at the door 
when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle- 
legged tables that supported so many frail-looking 
silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a 
large, cracked, black stone. 

“Sir,” said Harry, staring at it. “That ring — ” 

“Yes?” said Dumbledore. 

“You were wearing it when we visited Professor 
Slughorn that night.” 

“So I was,” Dumbledore agreed. 

“But isn’t it ... sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo 
Gaunt showed Ogden?” 

Dumbledore bowed his head. “The very same.” 

“But how come — ? Have you always had it?” 

Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, I acquired it very recently,” said Dumbledore. “A 
few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt 
and uncle’s, in fact.” 

“That would be around the time you injured your 
hand, then, sir?” 

“Around that time, yes, Harry.” 

Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling. 

“Sir, how exactly — ?” 

“Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another 
time. Good night.” 

“Good night, sir.”

HERMIONE’S HELPING HAND 

As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years’ free 
periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron 
had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to 
keep up with the vast amount of homework they were 
being set. Not only were they studying as though they 
had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had 
become more demanding than ever before. Harry 
barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall 
said to them these days; even Hermione had had to 
ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. 
Incredibly, and to Hermione ’s increasing resentment, 
Harry’s best subject had suddenly become Potions, 
thanks to the Half-Blood Prince. 

Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in 
Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and 
Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at 
his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes 
to see them purple in the face and straining as 
though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew 
that they were really struggling to make spells work 



Page | 243 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to 
get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing 
with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, 
but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if 
the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly 
from behind. 

One result of their enormous workload and the frantic 
hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find 
time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to 
meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the 
few occasions when they had passed him in the 
corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously 
failed to notice them or hear their greetings. 

“We’ve got to go and explain,” said Hermione, looking 
up at Hagrid ’s huge empty chair at the staff table the 
following Saturday at breakfast. 

“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron. 
“And we’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti 
Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are 
we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?” 

“We didn’t hate it!” said Hermione. 

“Speak for yourself, I haven’t forgotten the skrewts,” 
said Ron darkly. “And I’m telling you now, we’ve had a 
narrow escape. You didn’t hear him going on about 
his gormless brother — we’d have been teaching 
Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.” 

“I hate not talking to Hagrid,” said Hermione, looking 
upset. 

“Well go down after Quidditch,” Harry assured her. 

He too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he 
thought that they were better off without Grawp in 

Page | 244 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




their lives. “But trials might take all morning, the 
number of people who have applied.” He felt slightly 
nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his 
Captaincy. “I dunno why the team’s this popular all of 
a sudden.” 

“Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly 
impatient. “It’s not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you! 
You’ve never been more interesting, and frankly, 
you’ve never been more fanciable.” 

Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione 
spared him one look of disdain before turning back to 
Harry. 

“Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, 
don’t they? The whole Wizarding world has had to 
admit that you were right about Voldemort being back 
and that you really have fought him twice in the last 
two years and escaped both times. And now they’re 
calling you ‘the Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t 
you see why people are fascinated by you?” 

Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a 
sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and 
rainy. 

“And you’ve been through all that persecution from 
the Ministry when they were trying to make out you 
were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks 
on the back of your hand where that evil woman 
made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to 
your story anyway. ...” 

“You can still see where those brains got hold of me in 
the Ministry, look,” said Ron, shaking back his 
sleeves. 



Page | 245 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot 
over the summer either,” Hermione finished, ignoring 
Ron. 

“I’m tall,” said Ron inconsequentially. 

The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain- 
flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of 
water. Most people were receiving more post than 
usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their 
children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was 
well at home. Harry had received no mail since the 
start of term; his only regular correspondent was now 
dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might 
write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. 
He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy 
white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray 
owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, 
square package. A moment later, an identical package 
landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his 
minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. 

“Ha!” said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a 
new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from 
Flourish and Blotts. 

“Oh good,” said Hermione, delighted. “Now you can 
give that graffitied copy back.” 

“Are you mad?” said Harry. “I’m keeping it! Look, I’ve 
thought it out — ” 

He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out 
of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, 
muttering, “Diffindol” The cover fell off. He did the 
same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione 
looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, 
tapped each, and said, “Reparo\” 



Page | 246 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There sat the Prince’s copy, disguised as a new book, 
and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, 
looking thoroughly secondhand. 

“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can’t 
complain, it cost nine Galleons.” 

Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry 
and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl 
landing in front of her carrying that day’s copy of the 
Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned 
the front page. 

“Anyone we know dead?” asked Ron in a determinedly 
casual voice; he posed the same question every time 
Hermione opened her paper. 

“No, but there have been more dementor attacks,” 
said Hermione. “And an arrest.” 

“Excellent, who?” said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix 
Lestrange. 

“Stan Shunpike,” said Hermione. 

“What?” said Harry, startled. 

“ ‘Stanley Shunpike , conductor on the popular 
Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been 
arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. 
Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night 
after a raid on his Clapham home ...’ ” 

“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, 
remembering the spotty youth he had first met three 
years before. “No way!” 

“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” 
said Ron reasonably. “You never can tell.” 

Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still 
reading. “It says here he was arrested after he was 
overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret 
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled 
expression on her face. “If he was under the Imperius 
Curse, he’d hardly stand around gossiping about 
their plans, would he?” 

“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew 
more than he did,” said Ron. “Isn’t he the one who 
claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic 
when he was trying to chat up those veela?” 

“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re 
playing at, taking Stan seriously.” 

“They probably want to look as though they’re doing 
something,” said Hermione, frowning. “People are 
terrified — you know the Patil twins’ parents want 
them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already 
been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.” 

“What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “But 
Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! 
We’ve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, 
and we’ve got Dumbledore!” 

“I don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said 
Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table 
over the top of the Prophet “Haven’t you noticed? His 
seat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s this past 
week.” 

Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The 
headmaster’s chair was indeed empty. Now Harry 
came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore 
since their private lesson a week ago. 



Page | 248 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I think he’s left the school to do something with the 
Order,” said Hermione in a low voice. “I mean ... it’s 
all looking serious, isn’t it? 

Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that 
they were all thinking the same thing. There had been 
a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah 
Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her 
mother had been found dead. They had not seen 
Hannah since. 

When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later 
to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed 
Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what 
Hermione had said about the Patil twins’ parents 
wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was 
unsurprised to see that the two best friends were 
whispering together, looking distressed. What did 
surprise him was that when Ron drew level with 
them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked 
around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at 
her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk 
instantly became something more like a strut. Harry 
resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that 
Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had 
broken Harry’s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold 
and distant all the way down to the stadium through 
the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in 
the stands without wishing Ron good luck. 

As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the 
morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have 
turned up, from first years who were nervously 
clutching a selection of the dreadful old school 
brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, 
looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a 
large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately 
from the Hogwarts Express.

“We met on the train, in old Sluggy’s compartment,” 
he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to 
shake Harry’s hand. “Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.” 

“You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked Harry, 
taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking 
that he would probably block all three goal hoops 
without even moving. 

“I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,” 
said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. “Ate a 
pound of doxy eggs for a bet.” 

“Right,” said Harry. “Well ... if you wait over there ...” 

He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to 
where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a 
flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen’s face and 
wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential 
treatment because they were both “old Sluggy’s” 
favorites. 

Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all 
applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten 
and fly once around the pitch. This was a good 
decision: The first ten was made up of first years and 
it could not have been plainer that they had hardly 
ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain 
airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so 
surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal 
posts. 

The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest 
girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew 
his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching 
one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When 
he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite 
cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle 
everyone else.

The third group had a pileup halfway around the 
pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without 
broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs. 

“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from 
Gryffindor,” roared Harry, who was starting to get 
seriously annoyed, “leave now, please!” 

There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws 
went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter. 

After two hours, many complaints, and several 
tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty 
and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself 
three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after 
an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, 
who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and 
Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition 
and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though 
he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted 
himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now 
enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters. 

“That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of 
the way for the Keepers I’ll hex you,” he bellowed. 

Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of 
Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased 
with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested 
third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the 
size of an egg on the back of Harry’s head with a 
ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked 
weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, 

Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the 
selection of their last team member. 

Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers 
until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less 
pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all 

Page | 251 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the rejected players and a number of people who had 
come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had 
joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than 
ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the 
crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry 
glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem 
with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final 
match last term might have cured it, but apparently 
not: Ron was a delicate shade of green. 

None of the first five applicants saved more than two 
goals apiece. To Harry’s great disappointment, 

Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On 
the last one, however, he shot off in completely the 
wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and 
McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth. 

Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his 
Cleansweep Eleven. “Good luck!” cried a voice from 
the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see 
Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have 
quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as 
she did a moment later, but thought that as the 
Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so 
turned to watch Ron do his trial. 

Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, 
three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and 
resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with 
difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, 
most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find 
McLaggen’s red face inches from his own. He stepped 
back hastily. 

“His sister didn’t really try,” said McLaggen 
menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple 
like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle 
Vernon’s. “She gave him an easy save.” 



Page | 252 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Rubbish,” said Harry coldly. “That was the one he 
nearly missed.” 

McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his 
ground this time. 

“Give me another go.” 

“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. 
Ron saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and 
square. Get out of my way.” 

He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch 
him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace 
and stormed away, growling what sounded like 
threats to thin air. 

Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at 
him. 

“Well done,” he croaked. “You flew really well — ” 

“You did brilliantly, Ron!” 

This time it really was Hermione running toward 
them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking 
off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather 
grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely 
pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he 
grinned at the team and at Hermione. 

After fixing the time of their first full practice for the 
following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade 
good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off 
toward Hagrid’s. A watery sun was trying to break 
through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling 
at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there 
would be something to eat at Hagrid’s. 



Page | 253 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” 
Ron was saying happily. “Tricky shot from Demelza, 
did you see, had a bit of spin on it — ” 

“Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, 
looking amused. 

“I was better than that McLaggen anyway,” said Ron 
in a highly satisfied voice. “Did you see him 
lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? 
Looked like he’d been Confunded. ...” 

To Harry’s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep 
shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he 
was too busy describing each of his other penalties in 
loving detail. 

The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in 
front of Hagrid’s cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp 
beak at their approach and turned his huge head 
toward them. 

“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit 
scary, isn’t he?” 

“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said 
Ron. 

Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the 
hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. 
After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too. 

“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, 
moving forward to stroke the feathery head. “Missing 
him? But you’re okay here with Hagrid, aren’t you?” 

“Oi!” said a loud voice. 



Page | 254 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his 
cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a 
sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, 
was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and 
bounded forward. 

“Git away from him! Hell have yer fingers — oh. It’s 
yeh lot.” 

Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, 
attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked 
at them all for a split second, then turned and strode 
into his cabin, slamming the door behind him. 

“Oh dear!” said Hermione, looking stricken. 

“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly. He walked 
over to the door and knocked loudly. 

“Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!” 

There was no sound from within. 

“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry 
said, pulling out his wand. 

“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t 
possibly — ” 

“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back — ” 

But before he could say anything else, the door flew 
open again as Harry had known it would, and there 
stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, 
despite the flowery apron, positively alarming. 

“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! 
How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!” 



Page | 255 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm sorry, sir,” said Harry, emphasizing the last word 
as he stowed his wand inside his robes. 

Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called 
me ‘sir’?” 



“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?” 

“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. 
That’s me outsmarted, innit? All righ’, come in then, 
yeh ungrateful little ...” 

Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. 
Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather 
frightened. 

“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden 
table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry’s 
knee and drooling all over his robes. “What’s this? 
Feelin’ sorry for me? Reckon I’m lonely or summat?” 

“No,” said Harry at once. “We wanted to see you.” 

“We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously. 

“Missed me, have yeh?” snorted Hagrid. “Yeah. Righ’.” 

He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous 
copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he 
slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of 
mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of 
his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for 
Hagrid’s cooking, and took one at once. 

“Hagrid,” said Hermione timidly, when he joined them 
at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a 
brutality that suggested that each tuber had done 



Page | 256 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




him a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to 
carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.” 



Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought 
some bogeys landed on the potatoes, and was 
inwardly thankful that they were not staying for 
dinner. 

“We did!” said Hermione. “But none of us could fit it 
into our schedules!” 

“Yeah. Righ’,” said Hagrid again. 

There was a funny squelching sound and they all 
looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and 
Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table 
away from the large barrel standing in the corner that 
they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked 
like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing. 

“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound 
interested rather than revolted, but putting down his 
rock cake all the same. 

“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid. 

“And they grow into ... ?” said Ron, looking 
apprehensive. 

“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em 
ter feed ter Aragog.” 

And without warning, he burst into tears. 

“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying 
around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of 
maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking 
shoulders. “What is it?” 

Page | 257 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s ... him ...” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes 
streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. “It’s 
... Aragog. ... I think he’s dyin’. ... He got ill over the 
summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. ... I don’ know 
what I’ll do if he ... if he ... We’ve bin tergether so 
long. ...” 

Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a 
complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how 
she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious 
baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over 
giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to 
reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this 
was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his 
monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, 
who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which 
he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years 
previously. 

“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione 
asked, ignoring Ron’s frantic grimaces and head- 
shakings. 

“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, 
attempting to stem the flood of his tears. “See, the 
rest o’ the tribe ... Aragog’s family ... they’re gettin’ a 
bit funny now he’s ill ... bit restive ...” 

“Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said 
Ron in an undertone. 

"... I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go 
near the colony at the mo’,” Hagrid finished, blowing 
his nose hard on his apron and looking up. “But 
thanks fer offerin’, Hermione. ... It means a lot. ...” 

After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for 
although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any 
inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, 

Page | 258 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for 
granted that they would have liked to have done and 
became his usual self once more. 

“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me 
inter yer timetables,” he said gruffly, pouring them 
more tea. “Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners — ” 

“We couldn’t have done,” said Hermione. “We 
smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners 
when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily 
Prophet.” 

“Ar, well then,” said Hagrid. “There’s no way yeh 
could’ve done it. ... I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh know — 
I’ve jus’ bin worried abou’ Aragog ... an’ I did wonder 
whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin’ 
yeh 

At which all three of them stated categorically and 
untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had 
substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful 
teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved 
them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite 
cheerful. 

“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed 
behind them and they were hurrying through the 
dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the 
rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one 
of his back teeth. “And I’ve got that detention with 
Snape tonight, I haven’t got much time for dinner. ...” 

As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac 
McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two 
attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off 
the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed 
gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but 
Harry caught Hermione ’s arm and held her back. 

Page | 259 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What?” said Hermione defensively. 



“If you ask me,” said Harry quietly, “McLaggen looks 
like he was Confunded this morning. And he was 
standing right in front of where you were sitting.” 

Hermione blushed. 

“Oh, all right then, I did it,” she whispered. “But you 
should have heard the way he was talking about Ron 
and Ginny! Anyway, he’s got a nasty temper, you saw 
how he reacted when he didn’t get in — you wouldn’t 
have wanted someone like that on the team.” 

“No,” said Harry. “No, I suppose that’s true. But 
wasn’t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you’re a 
prefect, aren’t you?” 

“Oh, be quiet,” she snapped, as he smirked. 

“What are you two doing?” demanded Ron, 
reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and 
looking suspicious. 

“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and 
they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made 
Harry’s stomach ache with hunger, but they had 
barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table 
when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, 
blocking their path. 

“Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!” he 
boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus 
mustache and puffing out his enormous belly. “I was 
hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to 
a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We’re 
having a little party, just a few rising stars, I’ve got 
McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda 
Bobbin — I don’t know whether you know her? Her 
Page | 260 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




family owns a large chain of apothecaries — and, of 
course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor 
me by coming too.” 

Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished 
speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; 
Slughorn did not so much as look at him. 

“I can’t come, Professor,” said Harry at once. “I’ve got 
a detention with Professor Snape.” 

“Oh dear!” said Slughorn, his face falling comically. 
“Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, 
I’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain 
the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to persuade him to 
postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later!” 

He bustled away out of the Hall. 

“He’s got no chance of persuading Snape,” said Harry, 
the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. “This 
detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it 
for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else.” 

“Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my 
own!” said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she 
was thinking about McLaggen. 

“I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,” 
snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly 
to being ignored by Slughorn. 

After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor 
Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most 
people had finished dinner by now, but they managed 
to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been 
in a bad mood ever since the encounter with 
Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. 
Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening 
Page | 261 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a 
chair. 

“Anything new?” said Harry. 

“Not really ...” Hermione had opened the newspaper 
and was scanning the inside pages. “Oh, look, your 
dad’s in here, Ron — he’s all right!” she added 
quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. “It just 
says he’s been to visit the Malfoys’ house. ‘This 
second search of the Death Eater’s residence does not 
seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of 
the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of 
Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects 
said that his team had been acting upon a confidential 
tip-off’” 

“Yeah, mine!” said Harry. “I told him at King’s Cross 
about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get 
Borgin to fix! Well, if it’s not at their house, he must 
have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him — ” 

“But how can he have done, Harry?” said Hermione, 
putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. 
“We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we?” 

“Were you?” said Harry, taken aback. “I wasn’t!” 

“Oh no, of course you weren’t, I forgot you were late. 

... Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors 
when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object 
would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had 
a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can’t 
have brought in anything dangerous!” 

Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley 
playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before 
seeing a way around this objection. 



Page | 262 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said. “His 
mother or someone.” 

“All the owls are being checked too,” said Hermione. 
“Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy 
Sensors everywhere he could reach.” 

Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to 
say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could 
have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the 
school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting 
with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown. 

“Can you think of any way Malfoy — ?” 

“Oh, drop it, Harry,” said Ron. 

“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione 
and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to 
go, you know!” said Harry, firing up. 

“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said Ron, 
getting to his feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.” 

He stomped off toward the door to the boys’ 
dormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring after 
him. 

“Harry?” said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, 
appearing suddenly at his shoulder. “I’ve got a 
message for you.” 

“From Professor Slughorn?” asked Harry, sitting up 
hopefully. 

“No ... from Professor Snape,” said Demelza. Harry’s 
heart sank. “He says you’re to come to his office at 
half past eight tonight to do your detention — er — no 
matter how many party invitations you’ve received. 

Page | 263 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting out 
rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions 
and — and he says there’s no need to bring protective 
gloves.” 

“Right,” said Harry grimly. “Thanks a lot, Demelza.”

SILVER AND OPALS 

Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? 
Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over 
the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals 
anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in 
thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a 
time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was 
supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said 
that the lessons were leading to something to do with 
the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, 
and now he felt slightly abandoned. 

Halfway through October came their first trip of the 
term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether 
these trips would still be allowed, given the 
increasingly tight security measures around the 
school, but was pleased to know that they were going 
ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle 
grounds for a few hours. 

Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which 
was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until 



Page | 265 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion- 
Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his 
textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, 
was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was 
simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the 
Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making 
hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored 
over the book, the more he realized how much was in 
there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on 
potions that were earning him such a glowing 
reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative 
little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which 
Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and 
revisions, that the Prince had invented himself. 

Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince’s self- 
invented spells. There had been a hex that caused 
toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on 
Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); 
a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth 
(which he had twice used, to general applause, on an 
unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful 
of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone 
nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy 
conversations could be held in class without being 
overheard. The only person who did not find these 
charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a 
rigidly disapproving expression throughout and 
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato 
spell on anyone in the vicinity. 

Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so 
as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions 
for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince 
some trouble. There were many crossings-out and 
alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the 
page, the scribble: 

Levicorpus (nvbl) 

Page | 266 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the 
windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at 
the letters in brackets. Nvbl ... that had to mean 
“nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able 
to bring off this particular spell; he was still having 
difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had 
been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On 
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more 
effective teacher than Snape so far. 

Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it 
an upward flick and said Levicorpusl inside his head. 

“ Aaaaaaaargh ! ” 

There was a flash of light and the room was full of 
voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a 
yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in 
panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as 
though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the 
ankle. 

“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared 
with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the 
floor, having fallen out of bed. “Hang on — I’ll let you 
down — ” 

He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in 
a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he 
located it and deciphered one cramped word 
underneath the spell: Praying that this was the 
counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus\ with all his 
might. 

There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a 
heap onto his mattress. 

“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and 
Seamus continued to roar with laughter. 

Page | 267 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Tomorrow,” said Ron in a muffled voice, “I’d rather 
you set the alarm clock.” 

By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves 
out with several of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted 
sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, 
Ron’s shock had subsided and he had decided that 
Harry’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in 
fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with 
the story as they sat down for breakfast. 

"... and then there was another flash of light and I 
landed on the bed again!” Ron grinned, helping 
himself to sausages. 

Hermione had not cracked a smile during this 
anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry 
disapproval upon Harry. 

“Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that 
potion book of yours?” she asked. 

Harry frowned at her. 

“Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?” 
“Was it?” 

“Well ... yeah, it was, but so what?” 

“So you just decided to try out an unknown, 
handwritten incantation and see what would 
happen?” 

“Why does it matter if it’s handwritten?” said Harry, 
preferring not to answer the rest of the question. 

“Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic- 
approved,” said Hermione. “And also,” she added, as 

Page | 268 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m starting 
to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.” 



Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once. 

“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle 
over his sausages. “Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s 
all!” 

“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said 
Hermione. “Who puts their time and energy into 
making up spells like that?” 

“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their 
kind of thing. And, er — ” 

“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered. 

“What?” said Ron and Hermione together. 

“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told 
me.” 

This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen 
his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never 
told Ron and Hermione about that particular 
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a 
wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half- 
Blood Prince possibly be — ? 

“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, 
“but he’s not the only one. We’ve seen a whole bunch 
of people use it, in case you’ve forgotten. Dangling 
people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, 
helpless.” 

Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too 
remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the 
Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.

“That was different,” he said robustly. “They were 
abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a 
laugh. You don’t like the Prince, Hermione,” he added, 
pointing a sausage at her sternly, “because he’s better 
than you at Potions — ” 

“It’s got nothing to do with that!” said Hermione, her 
cheeks reddening. “I just think it’s very irresponsible 
to start performing spells when you don’t even know 
what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as 
if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it 
doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to 
me!” 

“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry 
heatedly. “If he’d been a budding Death Eater he 
wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ 
would he?” 

Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father 
had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out 
of his mind; he would worry about that later. ... 

“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t 
enough pure-blood wizards left,” said Hermione 
stubbornly. “I expect most of them are half-bloods 
pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they 
hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join 
up.” 

“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said 
Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he 
was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie 
Macmillan on the head. “My whole family are blood 
traitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death 
Eaters!” 



Page | 270 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically. 
“We’d be best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me 



in. 






This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging 
smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny. 

“Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this.” 

It was a scroll of parchment with Harry’s name 
written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing. 

“Thanks, Ginny ... It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” 
Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the 
parchment and quickly reading its contents. “Monday 
evening!” He felt suddenly light and happy. “Want to 
join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?” he asked. 

“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she 
replied, waving at them as she left. 

Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, 
checking off the names of people who had permission 
to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer 
than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody 
with his Secrecy Sensor. 

“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff 
OUT?” demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy 
Sensor with apprehension. “Surely you ought to be 
checking what we bring back IN?” 

His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the 
Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out 
into the wind and sleet. 

The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry 
wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed 
part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the 

Page | 271 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




village was full of students bent double against the 
bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether 
they might not have had a better time in the warm 
common room, and when they finally reached 
Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s Joke Shop had 
been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that 
this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with 
a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was 
mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered 
in his wake into the crowded shop. 

“Thank God,” shivered Ron as they were enveloped by 
warm, toffee-scented air. “Let’s stay here all 
afternoon.” 

“Harry, m’boy!” said a booming voice from behind 
them. 

“Oh no,” muttered Harry. The three of them turned to 
see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an 
enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching 
fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized 
pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the 
shop. 

“Harry, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed 
now!” said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. 
“It won’t do, m’boy, I’m determined to have you! Miss 
Granger loves them, don’t you?” 

“Yes,” said Hermione helplessly, “they’re really — ” 

“So why don’t you come along, Harry?” demanded 
Slughorn. 

“Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,” said 
Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices 
every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet 
ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that 

Page | 272 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh 
with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with 
McLaggen and Zabini. 

“Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match 
after all this hard work!” said Slughorn. “But a little 
recreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about 
Monday night, you can’t possibly want to practice in 
this weather. ...” 

“I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment 
with Professor Dumbledore that evening.” 

“Unlucky again!” cried Slughorn dramatically. “Ah, 
well ... you can’t evade me forever, Harry!” 

And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, 
taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a 
display of Cockroach Clusters. 

“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” 
said Hermione, shaking her head. “They’re not that 
bad, you know. ... They’re even quite fun sometimes. 
...” But then she caught sight of Ron’s expression. 

“Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those 
would last hours!” 

Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry 
showed much more interest in the new extra-large 
sugar quills than he would normally have done, but 
Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged 
when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go 
next. 

“Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks,” said Harry. “It’ll 
be warm.” 

They bundled their scarves back over their faces and 
left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on 

Page | 273 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. 
The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to 
chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The 
exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, 
standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was 
very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed 
glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in 
the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head. As Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his 
cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, 
leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in 
his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry 
realized who the man was. 

“Mundungus!” 

The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, 
ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, 
which burst open, releasing what looked like the 
entire contents of a junk shop window. 

“Oh, ’ello, ’Arry,” said Mundungus Fletcher, with a 
most unconvincing stab at airiness. “Well, don’t let 
me keep ya.” 

And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the 
contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a 
man eager to be gone. 

“Are you selling this stuff?” asked Harry, watching 
Mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking 
objects from the ground. 

“Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,” said Mundungus. 
“Gimme that!” 

Ron had stooped down and picked up something 
silver. 



Page | 274 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Hang on,” Ron said slowly. “This looks familiar — ” 



“Thank you!” said Mundungus, snatching the goblet 
out of Ron’s hand and stuffing it back into the case. 
“Well, I’ll see you all — OUCH!” 

Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the 
pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he 
pulled out his wand. 

“Harry!” squealed Hermione. 

“You took that from Sirius’s house,” said Harry, who 
was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was 
breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and 
spirits. “That had the Black family crest on it.” 

“I — no — what — ?” spluttered Mundungus, who 
was slowly turning purple. 

“What did you do, go back the night he died and strip 
the place?” snarled Harry. 

“I — no — ” 

“Give it to me!” 

“Harry, you mustn’t!” shrieked Hermione, as 
Mundungus started to turn blue. 

There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off 
Mundungus’s throat. Gasping and spluttering, 
Mundungus seized his fallen case, then — CRACK — 
he Disapparated. 

Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the 
spot to see where Mundungus had gone. 

“COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — !” 

Page | 275 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“There’s no point, Harry.” 



Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair 
wet with sleet. 

“Mundungus will probably be in London by now. 
There’s no point yelling.” 

“He’s nicked Sirius’s stuff! Nicked it!” 

“Yes, but still,” said Tonks, who seemed perfectly 
untroubled by this piece of information. “You should 
get out of the cold.” 

She watched them go through the door of the Three 
Broomsticks. 

The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, “He was 
nicking Sirius’s stuff.” 

“I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are 
staring,” whispered Hermione. “Go and sit down, I’ll 
get you a drink.” 

Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to 
their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of 
butterbeer. 

“Can’t the Order control Mundungus?” Harry 
demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. 

“Can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s 
not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?” 

“Shh!” said Hermione desperately, looking around to 
make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple 
of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry 
with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a 
pillar not far away. “Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I know 
it’s your things he’s stealing — ” 

Page | 276 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily 
forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld 
Place. 

“Yeah, it’s my stuff!” he said. “No wonder he wasn’t 
pleased to see me! Well, I’m going to tell Dumbledore 
what’s going on, he’s the only one who scares 
Mundungus.” 

“Good idea,” whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that 
Harry was calming down. “Ron, what are you staring 
at?” 

“Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the 
bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of 
the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, 
for whom he had long nursed a soft spot. 

“I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more 
firewhisky,” said Hermione waspishly. 

Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he 
evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry 
was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated 
those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her 
fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron 
and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last 
drops in his bottle she said, “Shall we call it a day 
and go back to school, then?” 

The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and 
the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. 
Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around 
them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, 
then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub 
and back up the High Street. Harry’s thoughts 
strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to 
Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met 
up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because 
Page | 277 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam 
Puddifoot’s Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. 
Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet 
and trudged on. 

It was a little while before Harry became aware that 
the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were 
being carried back to him on the wind, had become 
shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct 
figures. The two girls were having an argument about 
something Katie was holding in her hand. “It’s 
nothing to do with you, Leanne!” Harry heard Katie 
say. 

They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick 
and fast, blurring Harry’s glasses. Just as he raised a 
gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold 
of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back 
and the package fell to the ground. 

At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, 
suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her 
arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. 

Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. ... 
Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, 
but her eyes were closed and her face was quite 
empty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and 
Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching. 

Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a 
terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she 
could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly 
causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and 
screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized 
Katie’s ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, 
but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, she fell on top 
of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she 
was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. 
Page | 278 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Instead they lowered her to the ground where she 
thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to 
recognize any of them. 

Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted. 

“Stay there!” he shouted at the others over the 
howling wind. “I’m going for help!” 

He began to sprint toward the school; he had never 
seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and 
could not think what had caused it; he hurtled 
around a bend in the lane and collided with what 
seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs. 

“Hagrid!” he panted, disentangling himself from the 
hedgerow into which he had fallen. 

“Harry!” said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his 
eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, 
shaggy beaverskin coat. “Jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s 
cornin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ — ” 

“Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or 
something — ” 

“Wha?” said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what 
Harry was saying over the raging wind. 

“Someone’s been cursed!” bellowed Harry. 

“Cursed? Who’s bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione?” 

“No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way ...” 

Together they ran back along the lane. It took them 
no time to find the little group of people around Katie, 
who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; 



Page | 279 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet 
her. 

“Get back!” shouted Hagrid. “Lemme see her!” 

“Something’s happened to her!” sobbed Leanne. “I 
don’t know what — ” 

Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a 
word, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran 
off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katie’s 
piercing screams had died away and the only sound 
was the roar of the wind. 

Hermione hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and 
put an arm around her. 

“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?” 

The girl nodded. 

“Did it just happen all of a sudden, or — ?” 

“It was when that package tore,” sobbed Leanne, 
pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on 
the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish 
glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but 
Harry seized his arm and pulled him back. 

“Don’t touch if!” 

He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was 
visible, poking out of the paper. 

“I’ve seen that before,” said Harry, staring at the 
thing. “It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages 
ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have 
touched it.” He looked up at Leanne, who had started 



Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




to shake uncontrollably. “How did Katie get hold of 
this?” 



“Well, that’s why we were arguing. She came back 
from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding 
it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts 
and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when 
she said it. ... Oh no, oh no, I bet she’d been 
Imperiused and I didn’t realize!” 

Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted 
her shoulder gently. 

“She didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne?” 

“No ... she wouldn’t tell me ... and I said she was 
being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she 
just wouldn’t listen and ... and then I tried to grab it 
from her . . . and — and — ” 

Leanne let out a wail of despair. 

“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her 
arm still around Leanne. “We’ll be able to find out 
how she is. Come on. ...” 

Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf 
from around his face and, ignoring Ron’s gasp, 
carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up. 

“Well need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,” he said. 

As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, 
Harry was thinking furiously. They had just entered 
the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his 
thoughts to himself any longer. 

“Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at 
Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a 

Page | 281 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




good look at it while I was hiding from him and his 
dad. This is what he was buying that day when we 
followed him! He remembered it and he went back for 
it!” 



“I — I dunno, Harry,” said Ron hesitantly. “Loads of 
people go to Borgin and Burkes ... and didn’t that girl 
say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?” 

“She said she came back from the bathroom with it, 
she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ” 

“McGonagall!” said Ron warningly. 

Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall 
was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling 
sleet to meet them. 

“Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie 
Bell — upstairs to my office at once, please! What’s 
that you’re holding, Potter?” 

“It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry. 

“Good lord,” said Professor McGonagall, looking 
alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. “No, no, 
Filch, they’re with me!” she added hastily, as Filch 
came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall 
holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. “Take this necklace 
to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch 
it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!” 

Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall 
upstairs and into her office. The sleet-spattered 
windows were rattling in their frames, and the room 
was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. 
Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept 
around her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and 
the still sobbing Leanne. 

Page | 282 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well?” she said sharply. “What happened?” 



Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted 
to control her crying, Leanne told Professor 
McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in 
the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the 
unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little 
odd, and how they had argued about the advisability 
of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument 
culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore 
open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there 
was no getting another word out of her. 

“All right,” said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, 
“go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get 
Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.” 

When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall 
turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?” 

“She rose up in the air,” said Harry, before either Ron 
or Hermione could speak, “and then began to scream, 
and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor 
Dumbledore, please?” 

“The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,” said 
Professor McGonagall, looking surprised. 

“Away?” Harry repeated angrily. 

“Yes, Potter, away!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. 
“But anything you have to say about this horrible 
business can be said to me, I’m sure!” 

For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor 
McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, 
though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed 

Page | 283 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a 
life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to 
worry about being laughed at. 

“I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, 
Professor.” 

On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent 
embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her 
feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance 
between herself and Harry. 

“That is a very serious accusation, Potter,” said 
Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. “Do you 
have any proof?” 

“No,” said Harry, “but ...” and he told her about 
following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the 
conversation they had overheard between him and 
Mr. Borgin. 

When he had finished speaking, Professor 
McGonagall looked slightly confused. 

“Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for 
repair?” 

“No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how 
to mend something, he didn’t have it with him. But 
that’s not the point, the thing is that he bought 
something at the same time, and I think it was that 
necklace — ” 

“You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar 
package?” 

“No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop 
for him — ” 



Page | 284 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Borgin asked 
him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said 



no — 






“Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said 
Harry angrily. 

“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look 
carrying that down the street?’ ” said Hermione. 

“Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a 
necklace,” interjected Ron. 

“Oh, Ron,” said Hermione despairingly, “it would be 
all wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and 
quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see 
it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes 
was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw 
attention to him if he carried it down the street — and 
in any case,” she pressed on loudly, before Harry 
could interrupt, “I asked Borgin about the necklace, 
don’t you remember? When I went in to try and find 
out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it 
there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say 
it was already sold or anything — ” 

“Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what 
you were up to within about five seconds, of course 
he wasn’t going to tell you — anyway, Malfoy could’ve 
sent off for it since — ” 

“That’s enough!” said Professor McGonagall, as 
Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking 
furious. “Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but 
we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy 
purely because he visited the shop where this 
necklace might have been purchased. The same is 
probably true of hundreds of people — ” 



Page | 285 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“ — that’s what I said — ” muttered Ron. 



“ — and in any case, we have put stringent security 
measures in place this year. I do not believe that 
necklace can possibly have entered this school 
without our knowledge — ” 

“But — ” 

“ — and what is more,” said Professor McGonagall, 
with an air of awful finality, “Mr. Malfoy was not in 
Hogsmeade today.” 

Harry gaped at her, deflating. 

“How do you know, Professor?” 

“Because he was doing detention with me. He has 
now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework 
twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your 
suspicions, Potter,” she said as she marched past 
them, “but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to 
check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.” 

She held open her office door. They had no choice but 
to file past her without another word. 

Harry was angry with the other two for siding with 
McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in 
once they started discussing what had happened. 

“So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the 
necklace to?” asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to 
the common room. 

“Goodness only knows,” said Hermione. “But whoever 
it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have 
opened that package without touching the necklace.” 



Page | 286 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said 
Harry. “Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to 
get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or 
Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really 
wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided 
with Dumbledore. Or — ” 

“Or you,” said Hermione, looking troubled. 

“Couldn’t have been,” said Harry, “or Katie would’ve 
just turned around in the lane and given it to me, 
wouldn’t she? I was behind her all the way out of the 
Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more 
sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what 
with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I 
wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?” 

“Harry, Malfoy wasn’t in Hogsmeade!” said Hermione, 
actually stamping her foot in frustration. 

“He must have used an accomplice, then,” said Harry. 
“Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another 
Death Eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than 
Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up — ” 

Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said 
There’s no point arguing with him. 

“Dilligrout,” said Hermione firmly as they reached the 
Fat Lady. 

The portrait swung open to admit them to the 
common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp 
clothing; many people seemed to have returned from 
Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There 
was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, 
the news of Katie’s fate had not yet spread.

“It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop 
and think about it,” said Ron, casually turfing a first 
year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so 
that he could sit down. “The curse didn’t even make it 
into the castle. Not what you’d call foolproof.” 

“You’re right,” said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the 
chair with her foot and offering it to the first year 
again. “It wasn’t very well thought-out at all.” 

“But since when has Malfoy been one of the world’s 
great thinkers?” asked Harry. 

Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him.

THE SECRET RIDDLE 

Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for 
Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by 
which time the news that she had been cursed had 
spread all over the school, though the details were 
confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, 
Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie 
herself had not been the intended target. 

“Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,” said Harry to Ron 
and Hermione, who continued their new policy of 
feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his 
Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory. 

Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would 
return from wherever he had been in time for Monday 
night’s lesson, but having had no word to the 
contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore ’s 
office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter. 
There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his 
hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled 
when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve 



Page | 289 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks 
of light over the ceiling. 



“You have had a busy time while I have been away,” 
Dumbledore said. “I believe you witnessed Katie’s 
accident.” 

“Yes, sir. How is she?” 

“Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. 
She appears to have brushed the necklace with the 
smallest possible amount of skin: There was a tiny 
hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even 
held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, 
perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able 
to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse — 



“Why him?” asked Harry quickly. “Why not Madam 
Pomfrey?” 

“Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the 
portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, 
Sirius’s great-great-grandfather, raised his head from 
his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. “I 
would not have permitted a student to question the 
way Hogwarts operated in my day.” 

“Yes, thank you, Phineas,” said Dumbledore 
quellingly. “Professor Snape knows much more about 
the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, 
the St. Mungo’s staff are sending me hourly reports, 
and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery 
in time.” 

“Where were you this weekend, sir?” Harry asked, 
disregarding a strong feeling that he might be 
pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by 
Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly. 

Page | 290 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I would rather not say just now,” said Dumbledore. 
“However, I shall tell you in due course.” 

“You will?” said Harry, startled. 

“Yes, I expect so,” said Dumbledore, withdrawing a 
fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes 
and uncorking it with a prod of his wand. 

“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “I met Mundungus in 
Hogsmeade.” 

“Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has 
been treating your inheritance with light-fingered 
contempt,” said Dumbledore, frowning a little. “He 
has gone to ground since you accosted him outside 
the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads 
facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be 
making away with any more of Sirius’s old 
possessions.” 

“That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black 
heirlooms?” said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he 
stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his 
portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place. 

“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did 
Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after 
Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?” 

“She told me of your suspicions, yes,” said 
Dumbledore. 

“And do you — ?” 

“I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate 
anyone who might have had a hand in Katie’s 
accident,” said Dumbledore. “But what concerns me 
now, Harry, is our lesson.” 

Page | 291 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons 
were so very important, why had there been such a 
long gap between the first and second? However, he 
said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as 
Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the 
Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once 
more between his long-fingered hands. 

“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of 
Lord Voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the 
handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his 
witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home 
in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, 
expecting the baby who would one day become Lord 
Voldemort.” 

“How do you know she was in London, sir?” 

“Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,” 
said Dumbledore, “who, by an odd coincidence, 
helped found the very shop whence came the 
necklace we have just been discussing.” 

He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had 
seen him swill them before, much as a gold 
prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery 
mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the 
Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with 
a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes. 

“Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was 
brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, 
oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the 
gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in 
rags and pretty far along ... Going to have a baby, see. 
She said the locket had been Slytherin’s. Well, we 
hear that sort of story all the time, ‘Oh, this was 
Merlin’s, this was, his favorite teapot,’ but when I 
looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few 
Page | 292 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of 
course, that made it near enough priceless. She didn’t 
seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy 
to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!” 

Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous 
shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the 
swirling mass of memory from whence he had come. 

“He only gave her ten Galleons?” said Harry 
indignantly. 

“Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,” 
said Dumbledore. “So we know that, near the end of 
her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in 
desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her 
one and only valuable possession, the locket that was 
one of Marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms.” 

“But she could do magic!” said Harry impatiently. 

“She could have got food and everything for herself by 
magic, couldn’t she?” 

“Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is 
my belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am 
right — that when her husband abandoned her, 
Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she 
wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also 
possible that her unrequited love and the attendant 
despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. 

In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused 
to raise her wand even to save her own life.” 

“She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?” 

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “Could you possibly 
be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?” 



Page | 293 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t 
she, not like my mother — ” 

“Your mother had a choice too,” said Dumbledore 
gently. “Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a 
son who needed her, but do not judge her too 
harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long 
suffering and she never had your mother’s courage. 
And now, if you will stand ...” 

“Where are we going?” Harry asked, as Dumbledore 
joined him at the front of the desk. 

“This time,” said Dumbledore, “we are going to enter 
my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail 
and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry ...” 

Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool 
surface of the memory and then he was falling 
through darkness again. ... Seconds later, his feet hit 
firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he 
and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old- 
fashioned London street. 

“There I am,” said Dumbledore brightly, pointing 
ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in 
front of a horse-drawn milk cart. 

This younger Albus Dumbledore ’s long hair and beard 
were auburn. Having reached their side of the street, 
he strode off along the pavement, drawing many 
curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of 
plum velvet that he was wearing. 

“Nice suit, sir,” said Harry, before he could stop 
himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they 
followed his younger self a short distance, finally 
passing through a set of iron gates into a bare 
courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building 
Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few 
steps leading to the front door and knocked once. 
After a moment or two, the door was opened by a 
scruffy girl wearing an apron. 

“Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. 
Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?” 

“Oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in 
Dumbledore ’s eccentric appearance. “Um ... just a 
mo’ ... MRS. COLE!” she bellowed over her shoulder. 

Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in 
response. The girl turned back to Dumbledore. “Come 
in, she’s on ’er way.” 

Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and 
white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly 
clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. 
Before the front door had closed behind them, a 
skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying 
toward them. She had a sharp-featured face that 
appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was 
talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper 
as she walked toward Dumbledore. 

"... and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy 
Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley’s 
oozing all over his sheets — chicken pox on top of 
everything else,” she said to nobody in particular, and 
then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped 
dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a 
giraffe had just crossed her threshold. 

“Good afternoon,” said Dumbledore, holding out his 
hand. 

Mrs. Cole simply gaped. 



Page | 295 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter 
requesting an appointment and you very kindly 
invited me here today.” 

Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that 
Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, 
“Oh yes. Well — well then — you’d better come into 
my room. Yes.” 

She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed 
part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the 
hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. 
She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and 
seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him 
nervously. 

“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom 
Riddle and arrangements for his future,” said 
Dumbledore. 

“Are you family?” asked Mrs. Cole. 

“No, I am a teacher,” said Dumbledore. “I have come 
to offer Tom a place at my school.” 

“What school’s this, then?” 

“It is called Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore. 

“And how come you’re interested in Tom?” 

“We believe he has qualities we are looking for.” 

“You mean he’s won a scholarship? How can he have 
done? He’s never been entered for one.” 

“Well, his name has been down for our school since 
birth — ” 



Page | 296 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Who registered him? His parents?” 



There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an 
inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore 
thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand 
out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time 
picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. 
Cole’s desktop. 

“Here,” said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he 
passed her the piece of paper, “I think this will make 
everything clear.” 

Mrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as 
she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment. 

“That seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly, 
handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of 
gin and two glasses that had certainly not been 
present a few seconds before. 

“Er — may I offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an 
extra-refined voice. 

“Thank you very much,” said Dumbledore, beaming. 

It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice 
when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a 
generous measure, she drained her own glass in one 
gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at 
Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn’t hesitate 
to press his advantage. 

“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything 
of Tom Riddle’s history? I think he was born here in 
the orphanage?” 

“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more 
gin. “I remember it clear as anything, because I’d just 

Page | 297 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




started here myself. New Year’s Eve and bitter cold, 
snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not 
much older than I was myself at the time, came 
staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the 
first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the 
hour. And she was dead in another hour.” 

Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another 
generous gulp of gin. 

“Did she say anything before she died?” asked 
Dumbledore. “Anything about the boy’s father, for 
instance?” 

“Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who 
seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin 
in her hand and an eager audience for her story. “I 
remember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks like his 
papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, 
because she was no beauty — and then she told me 
he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, 
for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn’t it? We 
wondered whether she came from a circus — and she 
said the boy’s surname was to be Riddle. And she 
died soon after that without another word. 

“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so 
important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo 
nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor 
any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and 
he’s been here ever since.” 

Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to 
another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had 
appeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, 
“He’s a funny boy.” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I thought he might be.” 



Page | 298 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you 
know. And then, when he got a little older, he was . . . 
odd.” 



“Odd in what way?” asked Dumbledore gently. 

“Well, he — ” 

But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing 
blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she 
shot Dumbledore over her gin glass. 

“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?” 

“Definitely,” said Dumbledore. 

“And nothing I say can change that?” 

“Nothing,” said Dumbledore. 

“You’ll be taking him away, whatever?” 

“Whatever,” repeated Dumbledore gravely. 

She squinted at him as though deciding whether or 
not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, 
because she said in a sudden rush, “He scares the 
other children.” 

“You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore. 

“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning 
slightly, “but it’s very hard to catch him at it. There 
have been incidents. ... Nasty things ...” 

Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could 
tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp 
of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still. 

Page | 299 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Billy Stubbs’s rabbit ... well, Tom said he didn’t do it 
and I don’t see how he could have done, but even so, 
it didn’t hang itself from the rafters, did it?” 

“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly. 

“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do 
it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day 
before. And then” — Mrs. Cole took another swig of 
gin, slopping a little over her chin this time — “on the 
summer outing — we take them out, you know, once 
a year, to the countryside or to the seaside — well, 
Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite 
right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was 
that they’d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He 
swore they’d just gone exploring, but something 
happened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well, there 
have been a lot of things, funny things. ...” 

She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though 
her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don’t 
think many people will be sorry to see the back of 
him.” 

“You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be 
keeping him permanently?” said Dumbledore. “He will 
have to return here, at the very least, every summer.” 

“Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with 
a rusty poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. 

She got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see 
that she was quite steady, even though two-thirds of 
the gin was now gone. “I suppose you’d like to see 
him?” 

“Very much,” said Dumbledore, rising too. 

She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, 
calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers 

Page | 300 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and children as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, 
were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. They 
looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no 
denying that this was a grim place in which to grow 
up. 

“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the 
second landing and stopped outside the first door in a 
long corridor. She knocked twice and entered. 

“Tom? You’ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton — 
sorry, Dunderbore. He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll 
let him do it.” 

Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, 
and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It was a small 
bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe, 
a wooden chair, and an iron bedstead. A boy was 
sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched 
out in front of him, holding a book. 

There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle’s 
face. Merope had got her dying wish: He was his 
handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years 
old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly 
as he took in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. 
There was a moment’s silence. 

“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking 
forward and holding out his hand. 

The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook 
hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair 
beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather 
like a hospital patient and visitor. 

“I am Professor Dumbledore.” 



Page | 301 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“ ‘Professor?” repeated Riddle. He looked wary. “Is 
that like ‘doctor? What are you here for? Did she get 
you in to have a look at me?” 

He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole 
had just left. 

“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling. 

“I don’t believe you,” said Riddle. “She wants me 
looked at, doesn’t she? Tell the truth!” 

He spoke the last three words with a ringing force 
that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it 
sounded as though he had given it many times 
before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at 
Dumbledore, who made no response except to 
continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds 
Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, 
warier still. 

“Who are you?” 

“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore 
and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come 
to offer you a place at my school — your new school, 
if you would like to come.” 

Riddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt 
from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, 
looking furious. 

“You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re 
from, isn’t it? ‘Professor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m 
not going, see? That old cat’s the one who should be 
in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy 
Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, 
they’ll tell you!” 



Page | 302 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I am not from the asylum,” said Dumbledore 
patiently. “I am a teacher and, if you will sit down 
calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if 
you would rather not come to the school, nobody will 
force you — ” 

“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle. 

“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had 
not heard Riddle’s last words, “is a school for people 
with special abilities — ” 

“I’m not mad!” 

“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a 
school for mad people. It is a school of magic.” 

There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face 
expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and 
forth between each of Dumbledore’s, as though trying 
to catch one of them lying. 

“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper. 

“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. 

“It’s ... it’s magic, what I can do?” 

“What is it that you can do?” 

“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was 
rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked 
fevered. “I can make things move without touching 
them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, 
without training them. I can make bad things happen 
to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I 
want to.” 



Page | 303 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat 
down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head 
bowed as though in prayer. 

“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own 
quivering fingers. “I knew I was special. Always, I 
knew there was something.” 

“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who 
was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. 
“You are a wizard.” 

Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: 

There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some 
reason it did not make him better looking; on the 
contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow 
rougher, his expression almost bestial. 

“Are you a wizard too?” 

“Yes, I am.” 

“Prove it,” said Riddle at once, in the same 
commanding tone he had used when he had said, 

“Tell the truth.” 

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “If, as I take it, you 
are accepting your place at Hogwarts — ” 

“Of course I am!” 

“Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’ ” 

Riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting 
moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite 
voice, “I’m sorry, sir. I meant — please, Professor, 
could you show me — ?” 



Page | 304 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, 
that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time 
for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they 
were currently in a building full of Muggles and must 
therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, 
Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of 
his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in 
the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick. 

The wardrobe burst into flames. 

Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame 
him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly 
possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle 
rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving 
the wardrobe completely undamaged. 

Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, 
his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. 

“Where can I get one of them?” 

“All in good time,” said Dumbledore. “I think there is 
something trying to get out of your wardrobe.” 

And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from 
inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened. 

“Open the door,” said Dumbledore. 

Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw 
open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above 
a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box 
was shaking and rattling as though there were several 
frantic mice trapped inside it. 

“Take it out,” said Dumbledore. 

Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked 
unnerved. 

Page | 305 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to 
have?” asked Dumbledore. 

Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating 
look. “Yes, I suppose so, sir,” he said finally, in an 
expressionless voice. 

“Open it,” said Dumbledore. 

Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto 
his bed without looking at them. Harry, who had 
expected something much more exciting, saw a mess 
of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble, 
and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free 
of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still 
upon the thin blankets. 

“You will return them to their owners with your 
apologies,” said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand 
back into his jacket. “I shall know whether it has 
been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated 
at Hogwarts.” 

Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still 
staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last 
he said in a colorless voice, “Yes, sir.” 

“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you 
not only to use magic, but to control it. You have — 
inadvertently, I am sure — been using your powers in 
a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our 
school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, 
to allow your magic to run away with you. But you 
should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and 
the Ministry of Magic — yes, there is a Ministry — will 
punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new 
wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they 
abide by our laws.” 



Page | 306 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, sir,” said Riddle again. 



It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his 
face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of 
stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he 
had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said 
baldly, “I haven’t got any money.” 

“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a 
leather money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a 
fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to 
buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of 
your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but — ” 

“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, 
who had taken the heavy money bag without 
thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat 
gold Galleon. 

“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list 
of books and school equipment with me. I can help 
you find everything — ” 

“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up. 
“Certainly, if you — ” 

“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing 
things for myself, I go round London on my own all 
the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley — sir?” 
he added, catching Dumbledore ’s eye. 

Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon 
accompanying Riddle, but once again he was 
surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope 
containing his list of equipment, and after telling 
Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from 
the orphanage, he said, “You will be able to see it, 
although Muggles around you — non-magical people,

that is — will not. Ask for Tom the barman — easy 
enough to remember, as he shares your name — ” 

Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to 
displace an irksome fly. 

“You dislike the name Tom’?” 

“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as 
though he could not suppress the question, as 
though it burst from him in spite of himself, he 
asked, “Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom 
Riddle too, they’ve told me.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice 
gentle. 

“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t 
have died,” said Riddle, more to himself than 
Dumbledore. “It must’ve been him. So — when I’ve got 
all my stuff — when do I come to this Hogwarts?” 

“All the details are on the second piece of parchment 
in your envelope,” said Dumbledore. “You will leave 
from King’s Cross Station on the first of September. 
There is a train ticket in there too.” 

Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held 
out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, “I can 
speak to snakes. I found out when we’ve been to the 
country on trips — they find me, they whisper to me. 
Is that normal for a wizard?” 

Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this 
strangest power until that moment, determined to 
impress. 

“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s 
hesitation, “but not unheard of.” 

Page | 308 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously 
over Riddle’s face. They stood for a moment, man and 
boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was 
broken; Dumbledore was at the door. 

“Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.” 

“I think that will do,” said the white-haired 
Dumbledore at Harry’s side, and seconds later, they 
were soaring weightlessly through darkness once 
more, before landing squarely in the present-day 
office. 

“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry. 

Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just 
seen. 

“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, 
when you told him he was a wizard,” said Harry. “I 
didn’t believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.” 

“Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was 
— to use his word — ‘special,’ ” said Dumbledore. 

“Did you know — then?” asked Harry. 

“Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous 
Dark wizard of all time?” said Dumbledore. “No, I had 
no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. 
However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned 
to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, 
something I should have done in any case, given that 
he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt 
I ought to do for others’ sake as much as his. 

“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well- 
developed for such a young wizard and — most 
interestingly and ominously of all — he had already 

Page | 309 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




discovered that he had some measure of control over 
them, and begun to use them consciously. And as 
you saw, they were not the random experiments 
typical of young wizards: He was already using magic 
against other people, to frighten, to punish, to 
control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and 
the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most 
suggestive. ... ‘I can make them hurt if I want to. ...”’ 

“And he was a Parselmouth,” interjected Harry. 

“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly 
connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, 
there are Parselmouths among the great and the good 
too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not 
make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for 
cruelty, secrecy, and domination. 

“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, 
indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. “But 
before we part, I want to draw your attention to 
certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, 
for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall 
be discussing in future meetings. 

“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I 
mentioned that another shared his first name, Tom’?” 

Harry nodded. 

“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied 
him to other people, anything that made him 
ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, 
separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, 
within a few short years of that conversation and 
created the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’ behind which he 
has been hidden for so long. 



Page | 310 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was 
already highly self-sufficient, secretive, and, 
apparently, friendless? He did not want help or 
companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He 
preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the 
same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters 
claiming that they are in his confidence, that they 
alone are close to him, even understand him. They 
are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, 
nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one. 

“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay 
attention to this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked 
to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles 
he had hidden in his room. These were taken from 
victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, 
of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind 
this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will 
be important later. 

“And now, it really is time for bed.” 

Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, 
his eyes fell upon the little table on which Marvolo 
Gaunt’s ring had rested last time, but the ring was no 
longer there. 

“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to 
a halt. 

“The ring’s gone,” said Harry, looking around. “But I 
thought you might have the mouth organ or 
something.” 

Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of 
his half-moon spectacles. 

“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only 
ever a mouth organ.” 

Page | 311 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who 
understood himself to be dismissed. 



Page | 312 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 








FELIX FELICIS 

Harry had Herbology first thing the following 
morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and 
Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over 
breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled 
them in as they walked across the vegetable patch 
toward the greenhouses. The weekend’s brutal wind 
had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and 
it took them a little longer than usual to find the 
correct greenhouse. 

“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said 
Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of 
the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this term’s 
project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. 
“But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing you 
all this. I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, 
but what’s the point?” 

“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he 
says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.” 



Page | 313 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“I think it’s fascinating,” said Hermione earnestly. “It 
makes absolute sense to know as much about 
Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his 
weaknesses?” 

“So how was Slughorn’s latest party?” Harry asked 
her thickly through the gum shield. 

“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now 
putting on protective goggles. “I mean, he drones on 
about famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely 
fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-connected, 
but he gave us some really nice food and he 
introduced us to Gwenog Jones.” 

“Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under 
his own goggles. “The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the 
Holyhead Harpies?” 

“That’s right,” said Hermione. “Personally, I thought 
she was a bit full of herself, but — ” 

“Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout 
briskly, bustling over and looking stern. “You’re 
lagging behind, everybody else has started, and 
Neville’s already got his first pod!” 

They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville 
with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along 
the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly 
pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit. 

“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said Ron, 
adding quietly, when she had turned away again, 
“should’ve used Muffliato, Harry.” 

“No, we shouldn’t!” said Hermione at once, looking, as 
she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the 



Page | 314 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Half-Blood Prince and his spells. “Well, come on ... 
we’d better get going. ...” 



She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all 
took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled 
stump between them. 

It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike 
vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. 
One tangled itself in Hermione’s hair, and Ron beat it 
back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in 
trapping a couple of vines and knotting them 
together; a hole opened in the middle of all the 
tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm 
bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around 
her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at 
the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and 
Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her 
fingers a pod just like Neville’s. At once, the prickly 
vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat 
there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood. 

“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in 
my garden when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, 
pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping 
sweat from his face. 

“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the 
pulsating pod at arm’s length; Harry handed one over 
and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust 
on her face. 

“Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best 
when they’re fresh!” called Professor Sprout. 

“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their 
interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood 
had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have 
a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way you’ll be 

Page | 315 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




able to wriggle out of this one because he actually 
asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be 
sure to have it on a night you can come.” 

Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting 
to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on 
it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, 
said angrily, “And this is another party just for 
Slughorn’s favorites, is it?” 

“Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione. 

The pod flew out from under Ron’s fingers and hit the 
greenhouse glass, rebounding onto the back of 
Professor Sprout’s head and knocking off her old, 
patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he 
got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, / didn’t make 
up the name ‘Slug Club’ — ” 

“ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of 
Malfoy. “It’s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your 
party. Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen, 
then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug — 



“We’re allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who 
for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, 
“and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think 
it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!” 

Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little 
farther, so that he need not have been sitting here 
with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized 
the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and 
open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he 
could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every 
word of their conversation. 



Page | 316 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a 
completely different voice. 

“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d 
rather I hooked up with McLaggen ...” 

There was a pause while Harry continued to pound 
the resilient pod with a trowel. 

“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice. 

Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it. 

“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his 
wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The 
crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and 
Hermione to Harry’s presence. Hermione looked 
flustered and immediately started fussing about for 
her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out 
the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the 
other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased 
with himself. 

“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It 
says we’re supposed to puncture them with 
something sharp. ...” 

Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron 
both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and 
dived, once more, for the stump. 

It was not as though he was really surprised, thought 
Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon 
throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might 
happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he 
felt about it. ... He and Cho were now too 
embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to 
each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going 
out together, then split up? Could their friendship 
Page | 317 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when 
they had not been talking to each other in the third 
year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance 
between them. And then, what if they didn’t split up? 
What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it 
became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their 
presence, so that he was shut out for good? 

“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the 
stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first 
one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling 
like pale green worms. 

The rest of the lesson passed without further mention 
of Slughorn’s party. Although Harry watched his two 
friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and 
Hermione did not seem any different except that they 
were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry 
supposed he would just have to wait to see what 
happened under the influence of butterbeer in 
Slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party. In 
the meantime, however, he had more pressing 
worries. 

Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo’s Hospital with no 
prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising 
Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully 
since September was one Chaser short. He kept 
putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would 
return, but their opening match against Slytherin was 
looming, and he finally had to accept that she would 
not be back in time to play. 

Harry did not think he could stand another full- 
House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to 
do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after 
Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had 
already left, although several twittering yellow birds 
were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione ’s 
Page | 318 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so 
much as a feather from thin air. 

“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?” 

“Wha — ? Yeah, of course!” said Dean excitedly. Over 
Dean’s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan 
slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of 
the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to 
have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus 
would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do 
what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown 
Seamus at the tryouts. 

“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice 
tonight, seven o’clock.” 

“Right,” said Dean. “Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can’t 
wait to tell Ginny!” 

He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and 
Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment 
made no easier when a bird dropping landed on 
Seamus’s head as one of Hermione’s canaries whizzed 
over them. 

Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the 
choice of Katie’s substitute. There was much 
muttering in the common room about the fact that 
Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the 
team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings 
than this in his school career, he was not particularly 
bothered, but all the same, the pressure was 
increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match 
against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that 
the whole House would forget that they had criticized 
him and swear that they had always known it was a 
great team. If they lost ... well, Harry thought wryly, 
he had still endured worse mutterings. ... 

Page | 319 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw 
Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and 
Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting 
better all the time. The only problem was Ron. 

Harry had known all along that Ron was an 
inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a 
lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming 
prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to 
have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting 
in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, 
his technique became wilder and wilder, until he 
finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the 
mouth. 

“It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” 
Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the 
ground, dripping blood everywhere. “I just — ” 

“Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to 
Demelza and examining her fat lip. “You prat, Ron, 
look at the state of her!” 

“I can fix that,” said Harry, landing beside the two 
girls, pointing his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and 
saying “Episkey.” “And Ginny, don’t call Ron a prat, 
you’re not the Captain of this team — ” 

“Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I 
thought someone should — ” 

Harry forced himself not to laugh. 

“In the air, everyone, let’s go. ...” 

Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had 
all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was 
the best policy when they were this close to the 
match. 

Page | 320 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” 
he said bracingly and the Chasers and Beaters left 
the changing room looking reasonably happy with 
themselves. 

“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a 
hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind 
Ginny. 

“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly. “You’re the best 
Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.” 

He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the 
way back to the castle, and by the time they reached 
the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more 
cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to 
take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, 
however, they found themselves looking at Dean and 
Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and 
kissing fiercely as though glued together. 

It was as though something large and scaly erupted 
into life in Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: 

Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all 
thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge 
to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden 
madness, he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great 
distance away. 

“Oi!” 



Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. 
“What?” said Ginny. 

“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in 
public!” 



Page | 321 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“This was a deserted corridor till you came butting 
in!” said Ginny. 

Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a 
shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn 
monster inside him was roaring for Dean’s instant 
dismissal from the team. 

“Er ... c’mon, Ginny,” said Dean, “let’s go back to the 
common room. ...” 

“You go!” said Ginny. “I want a word with my dear 
brother!” 

Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to 
depart the scene. 

“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of 
her face and glaring at Ron, “let’s get this straight 
once and for all. It is none of your business who I go 
out with or what I do with them, Ron — ” 

“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D’you think I 
want people saying my sister’s a — ” 

“A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. “A what, 
exactly?” 

“He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny — ” said Harry 
automatically, though the monster was roaring its 
approval of Ron’s words. 

“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry. “Just 
because he’s never snogged anyone in his life, just 
because the best kiss he’s ever had is from our Auntie 
Muriel — ” 

“Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and 
turning maroon. 

Page | 322 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself. “I’ve seen 
you with Phlegm, hoping shell kiss you on the cheek 
every time you see her, it’s pathetic! If you went out 
and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn’t 
mind so much that everyone else does it!” 

Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped 
swiftly between them. 

“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron 
roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around 
Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his 
arms outstretched. “Just because I don’t do it in 
public — !” 

Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push 
Harry out of the way. 

“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got 
a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your 
pillow?” 

“You—” 

A streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm 
and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up 
against the wall. 

“Don’t be stupid — ” 

“Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who 
sounded close to tears now. “And Hermione snogged 
Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something 
disgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about 
as much experience as a twelve-year-old!” 

And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go 
of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They 
both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, 

Page | 323 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Filch ’s cat, appeared around the corner, which broke 
the tension. 



“C’mon,” said Harry, as the sound of Filch ’s shuffling 
feet reached their ears. 

They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor 
corridor. “Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked at a small 
girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of 
toadspawn. 

Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he 
felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt 
must be something like this. It’s just because she’s 
Ron’s sister, he told himself. You just didn’t like seeing 
her kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister. ... 

But unbidden into his mind came an image of that 
same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny 
instead. ... The monster in his chest purred ... but 
then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain 
and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like 
“betrayal of trust” . . . “supposed to be my friend” . . . 

“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked 
abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry 
gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination 
away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in 
which he and Ginny were quite alone — 

“What?” he said confusedly. “Oh ... er ...” 

The honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to 
give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from 
the look on Harry’s face. 

“Dilligrout,” he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they 
climbed through the portrait hole into the common 
room. 

Page | 324 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; 
indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening 
and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own 
thoughts. 

Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the 
canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince 
himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder- 
brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother 
and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing 
Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He 
had known Ginny for years now. ... It was natural 
that he should feel protective . . . natural that he 
should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean 
limb from limb for kissing her ... No ... he would have 
to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . . 

Ron gave a great grunting snore. 

She’s Ron’s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron’s 
sister. She’s out-of-bounds. He would not risk his 
friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his 
pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for 
sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his 
thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny. 

Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and 
confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had 
chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he 
would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the 
real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny 
and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered 
Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What 
was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as 
touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast- 
Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to 
keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no 
success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high 
dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys’ dormitory 
Page | 325 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




after swearing angrily at several frightened first years 
for looking at him. 

To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear 
off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided 
with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which 
made him still more aggressive, so that during the 
final Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he 
failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at 
him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he 
reduced Demelza Robins to tears. 

“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, 
who was about two-thirds Ron’s height, though 
admittedly carrying a heavy bat. 

“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny 
glowering in Ron’s direction and, remembering her 
reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat- 
Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got 
out of hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. 
Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well 
today. Ron ...” he waited until the rest of the team 
were out of earshot before saying it, “you’re my best 
mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this 
and I’m going to kick you off the team.” 

He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit 
him, but then something much worse happened: Ron 
seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of 
him and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic.” 

“You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said 
Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. 
“You can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a 
mental problem you’ve got!” 

“You calling me mental?” 



Page | 326 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, maybe I am!” 

They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron 
shook his head wearily. “I know you haven’t got any 
time to find another Keeper, so I’ll play tomorrow, but 
if we lose, and we will, I’m taking myself off the team.” 

Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried 
boosting Ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ron 
was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione 
to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that 
evening, but his assertion that the whole team would 
be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined 
by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a 
huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about 
Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried 
getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into 
a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this 
strategy did not appear to work any better than 
encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and 
hopeless as ever. 

Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. 
He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only 
was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to 
beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not 
yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played 
as he had done in the last few practices, their 
chances of winning were very slim. ... 

If only there was something he could do to make Ron 
pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of 
his form . . . something that would ensure that Ron 
had a really good day. ... 

And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, 
glorious stroke of inspiration.

Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; 
the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every 
member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great 
Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, 
pale blue sky: a good omen. 

The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, 
cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned 
and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head. 

“Cheer up, Ron!” called Lavender. “I know you’ll be 
brilliant!” 

Ron ignored her. 

“Tea?” Harry asked him. “Coffee? Pumpkin juice?” 

“Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of 
toast. 

A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so 
tired of Ron’s recent unpleasant behavior that she 
had not come down to breakfast with them, paused 
on her way up the table. 

“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her 
eyes on the back of Ron’s head. 

“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing 
Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. “There you go, Ron. 
Drink up.” 

Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when 
Hermione spoke sharply. 

“Don’t drink that, Ron!” 

Both Harry and Ron looked up at her. 



Page | 328 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Why not?” said Ron. 



Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she 
could not believe her eyes. 

“You just put something in that drink.” 

“Excuse me?” said Harry. 

“You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something 
into Ron’s drink. You’ve got the bottle in your hand 
right now!” 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, 
stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket. 

“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said 
again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained 
it in one gulp, and said, “Stop bossing me around, 
Hermione.” 

She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only 
Harry could hear her, she hissed, “You should be 
expelled for that. I’d never have believed it of you, 
Harry!” 

“Hark who’s talking,” he whispered back. “Confunded 
anyone lately?” 

She stormed up the table away from them. Harry 
watched her go without regret. Hermione had never 
really understood what a serious business Quidditch 
was. He then looked around at Ron, who was 
smacking his lips. 

“Nearly time,” said Harry blithely. 

The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode 
down to the stadium. 

Page | 329 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” Harry 
asked Ron. 



“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking. 

Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their 
Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room. 

“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron. 

“And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he 
took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their 
practice, and he’s too sore to play! And even better 
than that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too!” 

“ What?” said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. 
“He’s ill? What’s wrong with him?” 

“No idea, but it’s great for us,” said Ginny brightly. 
“They’re playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and 
he’s an idiot.” 

Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his 
scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy 
had once before claimed he could not play due to 
injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the 
whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited 
the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a 
substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking? 

“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron. 
“Malfoy not playing?” 

“Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more 
animated. “And Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal 
scorer, I didn’t fancy — hey!” he said suddenly, 
freezing halfway through pulling on his Keeper’s 
gloves and staring at Harry. 

“What?” 

Page | 330 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I ... you ...” Ron had dropped his voice, he looked 
both scared and excited. “My drink ... my pumpkin 
juice ... you didn’t ... ?” 

Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, 
“Well be starting in about five minutes, you’d better 
get your boots on.” 

They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars 
and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and 
gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many 
Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: 
Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could 
distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood’s famous 
lion-topped hat. 

Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who 
was standing ready to release the balls from the crate. 

“Captains shake hands,” she said, and Harry had his 
hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, 

Urquhart. “Mount your brooms. On the whistle ... 
three ... two ... one ...” 

The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off 
hard from the frozen ground, and they were away. 

Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, 
looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on 
Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a 
voice that was jarringly different to the usual 
commentator’s started up. 

“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to 
see the team that Potter’s put together this year. 

Many thought, given Ronald Weasley’s patchy 
performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off 
the team, but of course, a close personal friendship 
with the Captain does help. ...” 

Page | 331 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




These words were greeted with jeers and applause 
from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned 
around on his broom to look toward the 
commentator’s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy with 
an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the 
magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan’s; 
Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player 
whom he heartily disliked. 

“Oh, and here comes Slytherin ’s first attempt on goal, 
it’s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and — ” 

Harry’s stomach turned over. 

“ — Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky 
sometimes, I suppose. ...” 

“That’s right, Smith, he is,” muttered Harry, grinning 
to himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his 
eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive 
Snitch. 

With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were 
leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some 
truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his 
gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor’s 
six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias 
wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only 
there because Harry liked them, and he started on 
Peakes and Coote instead. 

“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a 
Beater,” said Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a 
bit more muscle — ” 

“Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he 
zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to 
aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just 
passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was 

Page | 332 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the 
Bludger had found its mark. 

It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. 
Again and again they scored, and again and again, at 
the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with 
apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and 
when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with 
a rousing chorus of the old favorite “Weasley Is Our 
King,” he pretended to conduct them from on high. 

“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” 
said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off 
his broom as Harper collided with him hard and 
deliberately. “Your blood-traitor pal ...” 

Madam Hooch’s back was turned, and though 
Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she 
looked around, Harper had already sped off. His 
shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to 
ram him back. . . . 

“And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” 
said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. “Yes, 
he’s certainly seen something Potter hasn’t!” 

Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he 
noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach 
seemed to drop out of the sky — Smith was right and 
Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at 
random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The 
Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting 
brightly against the clear blue sky. 

Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears 
so that it drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary 
or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and 
Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper 



Page | 333 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now Harper 
was feet from it, his hand outstretched. ... 

“Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation. “How much 
did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?” 

He did not know what made him say it, but Harper 
did a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip 
through his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry 
made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and 
caught it. 

“YES!” Harry yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled 
back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his 
hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a 
great shout went up that almost drowned the sound 
of the whistle that signaled the end of the game. 

“Ginny, where ’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had 
found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair 
hug with the rest of the team, but Ginny sped right 
on past them until, with an almighty crash, she 
collided with the commentator’s podium. As the 
crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team 
landed beside the wreckage of wood under which 
Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard Ginny 
saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, 
“Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.” 

Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and 
hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her 
gaze, he clapped a cheering Ron on the back instead 
as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the 
pitch arm in arm, punching the air and waving to 
their supporters. 

The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. 



Page | 334 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Party up in the common room, Seamus said!” yelled 
Dean exuberantly. “C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!” 

Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing 
room. They were just about to leave when Hermione 
entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her 
hands and looked upset but determined. 

“I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep 
breath. “You shouldn’t have done it. You heard 
Slughorn, it’s illegal.” 

“What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded 
Ron. 

“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, 
turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of 
them would see him grinning. 

“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” 
said Hermione shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with 
lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!” 

“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them 
both. 

“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went 
right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron 
saved everything!” 

“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He 
slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew 
out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his 
hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and 
the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “I wanted 
Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you 
were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved 
everything because you felt lucky. You did it all 
yourself.” 

Page | 335 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He pocketed the potion again. 



“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” 
Ron said, astounded. “But the weather’s good ... and 
Vaisey couldn’t play. ... I honestly haven’t been given 
lucky potion?” 

Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a 
moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her 
voice. “ You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this 
morning, that’s why he saved every thing\ See! I can 
save goals without help, Hermione!” 

“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d 
been given it too!” 

But Ron had already strode past her out of the door 
with his broomstick over his shoulder. 

“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not 
expected his plan to backfire like this, “shall ... shall 
we go up to the party, then?” 

“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I’m 
sick of Ron at the moment, I don’t know what I’m 
supposed to have done. ...” 

And she stormed out of the changing room too. 

Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the 
castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted 
congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of 
letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, 
he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. 
He did not see how he could possibly explain to 
Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was 
kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred 
so long ago. 



Page | 336 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor 
celebration party, which was in full swing when he 
arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his 
appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of 
people congratulating him. What with trying to shake 
off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow 
match analysis, and the large group of girls that 
encircled him, laughing at his least amusing 
comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time 
before he could try and find Ron. At last, he 
extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was 
hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn’s 
Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward 
the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, 

Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and 
Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels. 

“Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He’s over 
there, the filthy hypocrite.” 

Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. 

There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron 
wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was 
hard to tell whose hands were whose. 

“It looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?” said 
Ginny dispassionately. “But I suppose he’s got to 
refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.” 

She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping 
sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to 
help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted 
after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold. 

Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he 
would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was 
closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a 
mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight. 



Page | 337 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, 
and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The 
corridor outside seemed to be deserted. 

“Hermione?” 

He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. 
She was sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for 
a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her 
head, which she had clearly just conjured out of 
midair. Harry could not help admiring her spell-work 
at a time like this. 

“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was 
just practicing.” 

“Yeah ... they’re — er — really good. ...” said Harry. 

He had no idea what to say to her. He was just 
wondering whether there was any chance that she 
had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the 
room because the party was a little too rowdy, when 
she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron 
seems to be enjoying the celebrations.” 

“Er . . . does he?” said Harry. 

“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione. 

“He wasn’t exactly hiding it, was — ?” 

The door behind them burst open. To Harry’s horror, 
Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand. 

“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry 
and Hermione. 

“Oops!” said Lavender, and she backed out of the 
room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her. 



Page | 338 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. 
Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at 
her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and 
awkwardness, “Hi, Harry! Wondered where you’d got 
to!” 

Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden 
birds continued to twitter in circles around her head 
so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of 
the solar system. 

“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she 
said quietly. “She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.” 

She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. 
Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that 
nothing worse had happened. 

“ Oppugno\” came a shriek from the doorway. 

Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her 
wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of 
birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets 
toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his 
hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at 
every bit of flesh they could reach. 

“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of 
vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door 
and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a 
sob before it slammed. 



Page | 339 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 

Snow was swirling against the icy windows once 
more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had 
already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve 
Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly 
and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of 
the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the 
helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of 
mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the 
corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge 
underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry 
went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; 
fortunately, however, Harry’s frequent nighttime 
wanderings had given him an unusually good 
knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that 
he was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate 
mistletoe-free routes between classes. 

Ron, who might once have found the necessity of 
these detours a cause for jealousy rather than 
hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. 
Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, 



Page | 340 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had 
been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved 
Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put 
up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, 
who seemed to regard any moment that she was not 
kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, 

Harry found himself once more the best friend of two 
people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each 
other again. 

Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches 
and cuts from Hermione’s bird attack, was taking a 
defensive and resentful tone. 

“She can’t complain,” he told Harry. “She snogged 
Krum. So she’s found out someone wants to snog me 
too. Well, it’s a free country. I haven’t done anything 
wrong.” 

Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed 
in the book they were supposed to have read before 
Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Quest). 
Determined as he was to remain friends with both 
Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with 
his mouth shut tight. 

“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled. 
“I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn’s 
Christmas party with her, but she never said ... just 
as friends ... I’m a free agent. ...” 

Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron 
was watching him. Ron’s voice tailed away in mutters, 
barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, 
though Harry thought he caught the words “Krum” 
and “can’t complain” again. 

Hermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only 
talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in 

Page | 341 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he 
did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione 
refused to sit in the common room while Ron was 
there, so Harry generally joined her in the library, 
which meant that their conversations were held in 
whispers. 

“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” 
said Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, 
prowled the shelves behind them. “I really couldn’t 
care less.” 

She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously 
that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry 
said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish 
from lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced 
Potion-Making and continued to make notes on 
Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher 
the Prince’s useful additions to Libatius Borage’s text. 

“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few 
moments, “you need to be careful.” 

“For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly 
hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of 
silence, “I am not giving back this book, I’ve learned 
more from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or 
Slughorn have taught me in — ” 

“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” 
said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though 
it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about earlier. I 
went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in 
here and there were about a dozen girls in there, 
including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to 
slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going 
to get you to take them to Slughorn ’s party, and they 
all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love 
potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work — ” 
Page | 342 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded 
Harry. It seemed extraordinary that Hermione’s mania 
for upholding rules could have abandoned her at this 
crucial juncture. 

“They didn’t have the potions with them in the 
bathroom,” said Hermione scornfully. “They were just 
discussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the Half- 
Blood Prince ” — she gave the book another nasty look 
— “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different 
love potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with 
you, thatll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got 
a chance. It’s tomorrow night, they’re getting 
desperate.” 

“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, 
who was still trying not to think about Ginny any 
more than he could help, despite the fact that she 
kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made 
him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform 
Legilimency. 

“Well, just be careful what you drink, because 
Romilda Vane looked like she meant business,” said 
Hermione grimly. 

She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which 
she was writing her Arithmancy essay and continued 
to scratch away with her quill. Harry watched her 
with his mind a long way away. 

“Hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “I thought Filch 
had banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard 
Wheezes?” 

“And when has anyone ever paid attention to what 
Filch has banned?” asked Hermione, still 
concentrating on her essay. 



Page | 343 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But I thought all the owls were being searched. So 
how come these girls are able to bring love potions 
into school?” 

“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes 
and cough potions,” said Hermione. “It’s part of their 
Owl Order Service.” 

“You know a lot about it.” 

Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had 
just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. 

“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed 
Ginny and me in the summer,” she said coldly. “I 
don’t go around putting potions in people’s drinks ... 
or pretending to, either, which is just as bad. ...” 

“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. 

“The point is, Filch is being fooled, isn’t he? These 
girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as 
something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have brought 
the necklace into the school — ?” 

“Oh, Harry ... not that again ...” 

“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry. 

“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect 
jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don’t they? 
They’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects. 
They’d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one 
on that necklace, within seconds. But something 
that’s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t 
register — and anyway, love potions aren’t Dark or 
dangerous — ” 

“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of 
Romilda Vane. 

Page | 344 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a 
cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt 
he can tell one potion from — ” 

Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. 
Somebody had moved close behind them among the 
dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later 
the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince 
appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her 
skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose 
illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was 
carrying. 

“The library is now closed,” she said. “Mind you 
return anything you have borrowed to the correct — 
what have you been doing to that book, you depraved 
boy?” 

“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, 
snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the 
table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. 

“Despoiled!” she hissed. “Desecrated! Befouled!” 

“It’s just a book that’s been written on!” said Harry, 
tugging it out of her grip. 

She looked as though she might have a seizure; 
Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, 
grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him 
away. 

“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. 
Why did you have to bring that stupid book?” 

“It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or 
d’you think she overheard you being rude about 
Filch? I’ve always thought there might be something 
going on between them. ...” 

Page | 345 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, ha ha ...” 



Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally 
again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp- 
lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about 
whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly 
in love with each other. 

“Baubles,” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the 
new, festive password. 

“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, 
and she swung forward to admit them. 

“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had 
climbed through the portrait hole. “Fancy a 
gillywater?” 

Hermione gave him a “what-did-I-tell-you?” look over 
her shoulder. 

“No thanks,” said Harry quickly. “I don’t like it much.” 

“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a 
box into his hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons, they’ve got 
firewhisky in them. My gran sent them to me, but I 
don’t like them.” 

“Oh — right — thanks a lot,” said Harry, who could 
not think what else to say. “Er — I’m just going over 
here with ...” 

He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing 
away feebly. 

“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly. “Sooner you ask 
someone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you 
can — ” 



Page | 346 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just 
spotted Ron and Lavender, who were entwined in the 
same armchair. 

“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it 
was only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for 
the girls’ dormitory without another word. 

Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was 
only one more day of lessons to struggle through, 
plus Slughorn’s party, after which he and Ron would 
depart together for the Burrow. It now seemed 
impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up 
with each other before the holidays began, but 
perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to 
calm down, think better of their behavior. . . . 

But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower 
after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them 
both next day. They had just embarked upon the 
immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; 
working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be 
changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione 
laughed unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, 
during which he somehow managed to give himself a 
spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by 
doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione 
jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor 
McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and 
Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced 
Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of 
the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things 
behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater 
than Ron’s just now, scooped up her remaining 
possessions and followed her. 

He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a 
girls’ bathroom on the floor below. She was 



Page | 347 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her 
vaguely on the back. 

“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of 
your eyebrows is bright yellow?” 

“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. ...” 

He held out her books. 

“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her 
things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that 
she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case. “Thank 
you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. ...” 

And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to 
offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could 
not think of any. 

“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it 
was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be 
Hermione. She said something about that Ron 
Weasley. ...” 

“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry. 

“He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” 
said Luna, as they set off down the corridor together. 
“But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.” 

“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her 
usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he 
had never met anyone quite like her. “So have you 
had a good term?” 

“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely 
without the D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She 
stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling 
me ‘Loony’ the other day — ” 

Page | 348 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with 
me tonight?” 

The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could 
stop them; he heard himself say them as though it 
were a stranger speaking. 

Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in 
surprise. 

“Slughorn’s party? With you?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “We’re supposed to bring guests, 
so I thought you might like ... I mean ...” He was keen 
to make his intentions perfectly clear. “I mean, just as 
friends, you know. But if you don’t want to ...” 

He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to. 

“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, 
beaming as he had never seen her beam before. 
“Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! 
Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? 
Should I do mine too?” 

“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get 
Hermione to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in 
the entrance hall at eight o’clock then.” 

“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of 
them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had 
just passed right underneath Peeves, who was 
hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning 
maliciously at them. 

“ Potty asked Loony to go to the partyl Potty lurves 
Loony ! Potty luuuuurves LooooooonyV’ 



Page | 349 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty 
loves Loony!” 

“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And 
sure enough, in no time at all the whole school 
seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna 
Lovegood to Slughorn’s party. 

“You could’ve taken anyonel” said Ron in disbelief 
over dinner. “Anyonel And you chose Loony 
Lovegood?” 

“Don’t call her that, Ron,” snapped Ginny, pausing 
behind Harry on her way to join friends. “I’m really 
glad you’re taking her, Harry, she’s so excited.” 

And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. 
Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was 
taking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage 
it. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting 
alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron 
looking at her furtively. 

“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly. 

“What, and get attacked by another flock of 
canaries?” muttered Ron. 

“What did you have to imitate her for?” 

“She laughed at my mustache!” 

“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.” 

But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had 
just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in 
between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms 
around Ron’s neck. 



Page | 350 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly 
embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two 
friends. 

“Hi,” said Harry. “How’re you? You’re staying at 
Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to 
leave.” 

“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” 
said Parvati. “That Katie thing really freaked them 
out, but as there hasn’t been anything since ... Oh, 
hi, Hermione!” 

Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she 
was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in 
Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that 
Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more 
brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. 

“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and 
Lavender completely. “Are you going to Slughorn’s 
party tonight?” 

“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, 
though, it sounds like it’s going to be really good. ... 
You’re going, aren’t you?” 

“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re — ” 

There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn 
from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione 
acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. 

“ — we’re going up to the party together.” 

“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you 
mean?” 



Page | 351 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who 
almost ’ — she put a great deal of emphasis on the 
word — “became Gryffindor Keeper.” 

“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, 
wide-eyed. 

“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a 
most un-Hermione-ish giggle. 

“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece 
of gossip. “Wow, you like your Quidditch players, 
don’t you? First Krum, then McLaggen ...” 

“I like really good Quidditch players,” Hermione 
corrected her, still smiling. “Well, see you ... Got to go 
and get ready for the party. ...” 

She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads 
together to discuss this new development, with 
everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and 
all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron 
looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was 
left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls 
would sink to get revenge. 

When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock 
that night, he found an unusually large number of 
girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring 
at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was 
wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were 
attracting a certain amount of giggles from the 
onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry 
was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish 
earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her 
Spectrespecs. 

“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?” 



Page | 352 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?” 



“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the 
marble staircase away from all the staring and 
muttering. “Did you hear, there’s supposed to be a 
vampire coming?” 

“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna. 

“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the 
Minister of Magic?” 

“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. 
“Father wrote a very long article about it when 
Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but 
he was forced not to publish by somebody from the 
Ministry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get 
out!” 

Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus 
Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna 
repeating her father’s bizarre views as though they 
were fact, did not reply; they were already 
approaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of 
laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing 
louder with every step they took. 

Whether it had been built that way, or because he 
had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn’s 
office was much larger than the usual teacher’s 
study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with 
emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it 
looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The 
room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red 
light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the 
center of the ceiling in which real fairies were 
fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing 
accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued 
from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over 
Page | 353 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a 
number of house-elves were negotiating their way 
squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by 
the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so 
that they looked like little roving tables. 

“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as 
Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. 
“Come in, come in, so many people I’d like you to 
meet!” 

Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match 
his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he 
might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, 
Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry 
seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him. 

“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old 
student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life 
Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend 
Sanguini.” 

Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, 
grabbed Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; 
the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated 
with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He 
looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing 
close to him, looking curious and excited. 

“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, 
peering shortsightedly up into Harry’s face. “I was 
saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 
‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we 
have all been waiting?’ ” 

“Er,” said Harry, “were you?” 

“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. 
“But seriously” — his manner changed; it became 

Page | 354 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




suddenly businesslike — “I would be delighted to 
write it myself — people are craving to know more 
about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to 
grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour 
sessions, why, we could have the book finished within 
months. And all with very little effort on your part, I 
assure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t quite — 
Sanguini, stay here\” added Worple, suddenly stern, 
for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby 
group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. “Here, 
have a pasty,” said Worple, seizing one from a passing 
elf and stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand before turning 
his attention back to Harry. 

“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no 
idea — ” 

“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and 
I’ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.” 

He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had 
indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear 
between what looked like two members of the Weird 
Sisters. 

“Hermione! HermioneV’ 

“Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!” 

“What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione 
looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had 
just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare. 

“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left 
Cormac,” she said. “Under the mistletoe,” she added 
in explanation, as Harry continued to look 
questioningly at her. 



Page | 355 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her 
severely. 



“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione 
dispassionately. “I debated for a while about 
Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole — ” 

“ You considered Smith?” said Harry, revolted. 

“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, 
McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let’s go 
this way, we’ll be able to see him coming, he’s so tall. 



The three of them made their way over to the other 
side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the 
way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was 
standing there alone. 

“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. 

“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, 
focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could 
smell cooking sherry again. “I haven’t seen you in my 
classes lately. ...” 

“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna. 

“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an 
angry, drunken titter. “Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think 
of him. You would have thought, would you not, that 
now I am returned to the school Professor 
Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no 
... we share classes. ... It’s an insult, frankly, an 
insult. Do you know ...” 

Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have 
recognized Harry. Under cover of her furious 
criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione 

Page | 356 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and said, “Let’s get something straight. Are you 
planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper 
tryouts?” 

Hermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think 
I’d stoop that low?” 

Harry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can 
ask out McLaggen — ” 

“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. 

“I’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what 
might, or might not, have happened at Keeper 
tryouts.” 

“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall 
apart again, and we’ll lose the next match — ” 

“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys 
care about? Cormac hasn’t asked me one single 
question about myself, no, I’ve just been treated to ‘A 
Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen’ 
nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!” 

She moved so fast it was as though she had 
Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, 
she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and 
vanished. 

“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way 
through the throng a minute later. 

“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join 
in Luna’s conversation, forgetting for a split second to 
whom she was talking. 

“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, 
vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. 



Page | 357 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically. 



“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. 
“The rumors! The stories! The Chosen One’! Of 
course, I have known for a very long time. ... The 
omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why have you 
not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the 
subject is of the utmost importance!” 

“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most 
important!” said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared 
at Professor Trelawney’s other side, his face very red, 
his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one 
hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I 
don’t think I’ve ever known such a natural at 
Potions!” said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, 
if bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you know — like his 
mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of 
ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus 



And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm 
and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward 
them. 

“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” 
hiccuped Slughorn happily. “I was just talking about 
Harry’s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must 
go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!” 

Trapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders, 
Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his 
black eyes narrowed. 

“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to 
teach Potter anything at all.” 

“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. 
“You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, 

Page | 358 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Draught of Living Death — never had a student 
produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even 
you, Severus — ” 

“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into 
Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he 
wanted was for Snape to start investigating the 
source of his newfound brilliance at Potions. 

“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, 

Harry?” asked Slughorn. 

“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, 
Transfiguration, Herbology ...” 

“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said 
Snape, with the faintest sneer. 

“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry 
defiantly. 

“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn. 

“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said 
Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. “The 
Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought 
everyone knew that. They’re working to bring down 
the Ministry of Magic from within using a 
combination of Dark Magic and gum disease.” 

Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started 
to laugh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just 
for this. Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping 
wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to 
raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being 
dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. 

“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver 
and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his 

Page | 359 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




bulging eyes, “I discovered this boy lurking in an 
upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to 
your party and to have been delayed in setting out. 

Did you issue him with an invitation?” 

Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch ’s grip, looking 
furious. 

“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “I was 
trying to gatecrash, happy?” 

“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds 
with the glee on his face. “You’re in trouble, you are! 
Didn’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling’s 
out, unless you’ve got permission, didn’t he, eh?” 

“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said 
Slughorn, waving a hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s not 
a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, 
we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.” 

Filch ’s expression of outraged disappointment was 
perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, 
watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally 
unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as 
though both angry and . . . was it possible? ... a little 
afraid? 

But almost before Harry had registered what he had 
seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering 
under his breath; Malfoy had composed his face into 
a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, 
and Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again. 

“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away 
Malfoy ’s thanks. “I did know your grandfather, after 
all. ...” 



Page | 360 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy 
quickly. “Said you were the best potion-maker he’d 
ever known. ...” 

Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that 
intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to 
Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, 
after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had 
seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy 
had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly 
grayish tinge to his skin. 

“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape 
suddenly. 

“Oh, now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, 
“it’s Christmas, don’t be too hard — ” 

“I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, 
or otherwise, to be,” said Snape curtly. “Follow me, 
Draco.” 

They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking 
resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, 
then said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — 
bathroom.” 

“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he 
heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume 
the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor 
Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested. 

It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his 
Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over 
himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was 
more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry 
ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by 
the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn ’s 
office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to 
Page | 361 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was 
escorting him back to the Slytherin common room. ... 
Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he 
dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of 
excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the 
last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. 

"... cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are 
expelled — ” 

“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?” 

“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both 
clumsy and foolish. Already you are suspected of 
having a hand in it.” 

“Who suspects me?” said Malfoy angrily. “For the last 
time, I didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had 
an enemy no one knows about — don’t look at me like 
that! I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid, but it 
won’t work — I can stop you!” 

There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah 
. . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, 

I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from 
your master, Draco?” 

“I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just 
don’t want you butting in!” 

Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the 
keyhole. ... What had happened to make Malfoy speak 
to Snape like this — Snape, toward whom he had 
always shown respect, even liking? 

“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? 
You have feared my interference? You realize that, 
had anybody else failed to come to my office when I 
had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco — ” 

Page | 362 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” 
jeered Malfoy. 

There was another pause. Then Snape said, “You 
know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of 
those things.” 

“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office 
then!” 

“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that 
Harry had to push his ear very hard against the 
keyhole to hear. “I am trying to help you. I swore to 
your mother I would protect you. I made the 
Unbreakable Vow, Draco — ” 

“Looks like you 11 have to break it, then, because I 
don’t need your protection! It’s my job, he gave it to 
me and I’m doing it, I’ve got a plan and it’s going to 
work, it’s just taking a bit longer than I thought it 
would!” 

“What is your plan?” 

“It’s none of your business!” 

“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist 
you — ” 

“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not 
alone!” 

“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish 
in the extreme, wandering the corridors without 
lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes — 



“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you 
hadn’t put them in detention!” 

Page | 363 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice 
had risen excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle 
intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts 
O.W.L. this time around, they will need to work a 
little harder than they are doing at pres — ” 

“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against 
the Dark Arts — it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? 
Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts 



“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said 
Snape. “Where do you think I would have been all 
these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen 
to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at 
night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing 
your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle — ” 

“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my 
side, better people!” 

“Then why not confide in me, and I can — ” 

“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my 
glory!” 

There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, 
“You are speaking like a child. I quite understand 
that your father’s capture and imprisonment has 
upset you, but — ” 

Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard 
Malfoy’s footsteps on the other side of the door and 
flung himself out of the way just as it burst open; 
Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the 
open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant 
corner, and out of sight. 



Page | 364 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched 
down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. 
His expression unfathomable, he returned to the 
party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath 
the cloak, his mind racing. 



Page | 365 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 

“So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely 
offering to help him?” 

“If you ask that once more,” said Harry, “I’m going to 
stick this sprout — ” 

“I’m only checking!” said Ron. They were standing 
alone at the Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a 
mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was 
drifting past the window in front of them. 

“Yes, Snape was offering to help himl” said Harry. “He 
said he’d promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, 
that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something — 



“An Unbreakable Vow?” said Ron, looking stunned. 
“Nah, he can’t have. ... Are you sure?” 

“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry. “Why, what does it 
mean?” 



Page | 366 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. ...” 

“I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. 
What happens if you break it, then?” 

“You die,” said Ron simply. “Fred and George tried to 
get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly 
did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything 
when Dad found us. He went mental,” said Ron, with 
a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. “Only time I’ve ever 
seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left 
buttock has never been the same since.” 

“Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock — ” 

“I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins 
entered the kitchen. 

“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and 
everything. Bless them.” 

“I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said 
Ron grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do it by magic!” 

“But meanwhile,” said George, sitting down at the 
kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, “we can 
enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a 
— whoops-a-daisy!” 

“You made me do that!” said Ron angrily, sucking his 
cut thumb. “You wait, when I’m seventeen — ” 

“I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto 
unsuspected magical skills,” yawned Fred. 

“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, 

Ronald,” said George, “what is this we hear from 
Ginny about you and a young lady called — unless 
our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?” 

Page | 367 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased 
as he turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own 
business.” 

“What a snappy retort,” said Fred. “I really don’t know 
how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know 
was . . . how did it happen?” 

“What d’you mean?” 

“Did she have an accident or something?” 

“What?” 

“Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain 
damage? Careful, now!” 

Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron 
throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into 
a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand. 

“Ronl” she said furiously. “Don’t you ever let me see 
you throwing knives again!” 

“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his 
breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain. 

“Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving 
tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.” 

“No problem,” said George. 

“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves 
Harry and Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with 
Ginny — ” 

“ — that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas — ” muttered Fred. 



Page | 368 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“ — everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have 
a bed, anyway,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly 
harassed. 



“Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?” 
asked Fred. 

Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. “No, 
he’s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.” 

“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. 
Weasley left the kitchen. “One of the two. Well, let’s 
get going, then, George.” 

“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Can’t you help 
us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand 
and then well be free too!” 

“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. 
“It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel 
sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how 
difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs — ” 

“ — and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added 
George, throwing the paper airplane at him, “I 
wouldn’t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. 
We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl 
working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks 
are something marvelous ... almost like real magic. 



“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George 
setting off across the snowy yard. “Would’ve only 
taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone 
too.” 

“I couldn’t,” said Harry. “I promised Dumbledore I 
wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.” 

Page | 369 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts 
and then said, “Are you going to tell Dumbledore what 
you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?” 

“Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can 
put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I 
might have another word with your dad too.” 

“Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, 
though.” 

“I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole 
point, he was refusing to tell Snape.” 

There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron 
said, “ ’Course, you know what they’ll all say? Dad 
and Dumbledore and all of them? They’ll say Snape 
isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to 
find out what Malfoy’s up to.” 

“They didn’t hear him,” said Harry flatly. “No one’s 
that good an actor, not even Snape.” 

“Yeah ... I’m just saying, though,” said Ron. 

Harry turned to face him, frowning. “You think I’m 
right, though?” 

“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But 
they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t 
they?” 

Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him 
that this would be the most likely objection to his new 
evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, 
Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick 
Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing. ... 



Page | 370 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




This was pure imagination, however, as he had had 
no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had 
overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn’s 
parry before he returned to it, or so he had been 
informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already 
gone to bed by the time he returned to the common 
room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the 
next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy 
Christmas and to tell her that he had some very 
important news when they got back from the 
holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard 
him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a 
thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the 
time. 

Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one 
thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and 
Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying “I 
told you so,” which he had done several times to Ron 
already. 

Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, 
who was working very long hours at the Ministry, 
until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their 
guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny 
had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like 
sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, 

Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the 
angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome 
that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up 
carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, 
stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings 
glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the 
ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald 
head like a potato and rather hairy feet. 

They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas 
broadcast by Mrs. Weasley’s favorite singer, Celestina 
Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large 

Page | 371 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find 
Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the 
corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her 
wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew 
louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy 
number called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” 
Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap 
with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert 
looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, 
Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged- 
looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring 
into its depths as though he could not hear 
Celestina’s voice. 

Oh, come and stir my cauldron, 

And if you do it right, 

I’ll boil you up some hot strong love 
To keep you warm tonight. 

“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. 
Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. “Do you 
remember, Arthur?” 

“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been 
nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh yes . . . 
marvelous tune ...” 

With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked 
around at Harry, who was sitting next to him. 

“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward 
the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. “Be 
over soon.” 

“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy 
at the Ministry?” 

“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were 
getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we’ve made 

Page | 372 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them 
is a genuine Death Eater — only don’t repeat that, 
Harry,” he added quickly, looking much more awake 
all of a sudden. 

“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” 
asked Harry. 

“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know 
Dumbledore’s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour 
about Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually 
interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a 
Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels 
want to look as though they’re making some progress, 
and ‘three arrests’ sounds better than ‘three mistaken 
arrests and releases’... but again, this is all top 
secret. ...” 

“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a 
moment, wondering how best to embark on what he 
wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, 
Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called “You 
Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.” 

“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station 
when we were setting off for school?” 

“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went 
and searched the Malfoys’ house. There was nothing, 
either broken or whole, that shouldn’t have been 
there.” 

“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked 
... but this is something different. ... Well, something 
more ...” 

And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard 
between Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw 
Lupin’s head turn a little toward him, taking in every 

Page | 373 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




word. When he had finished, there was silence, except 
for Celestina’s crooning. 

Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? 

It’s left me for a spell . . . 

“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, 
“that Snape was simply pretending — ?” 

“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out 
what Malfoy’s up to?” said Harry quickly. “Yeah, I 
thought you’d say that. But how do we know?” 

“It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin 
unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now 
and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. “It’s 
Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, 
and that ought to be good enough for all of us.” 

“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledore’s 
wrong about Snape — ” 

“People have said it, many times. It comes down to 
whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I 
do; therefore, I trust Severus.” 

“But Dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued Harry. 
“He says it himself. And you” — he looked Lupin 
straight in the eye — “do you honestly like Snape?” 

“I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin. “No, 
Harry, I am speaking the truth,” he added, as Harry 
pulled a skeptical expression. “We shall never be 
bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened 
between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too 
much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during 
the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the 
Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it 
Page | 374 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually 
do at the full moon.” 

“But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, 
so you had to leave!” said Harry angrily. 

Lupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out 
anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he 
could have wreaked much worse damage on me by 
tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I 
must be grateful.” 

“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with 
Dumbledore watching him!” said Harry. 

“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin 
with a faint smile. “And I understand; with James as 
your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have 
inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell 
Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but 
do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do 
not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell 
him. It might have been on Dumbledore’s orders that 
Severus questioned Draco.” 

... and now you’ve torn it quite apart 

I’ll thank you to give back my heart! 

Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched 
note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, 
which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically. 

“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, 
what an ’orrible — ” 

“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley 
loudly, leaping to his feet. “Who wants eggnog?” 



Page | 375 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked 
Lupin, as Mr. Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, 
and everybody else stretched and broke into 
conversation. 

“Oh, I’ve been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost 
literally. That’s why I haven’t been able to write, 

Harry; sending letters to you would have been 
something of a giveaway.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said 
Lupin. “Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s look of 
incomprehension. “Nearly all of them are on 
Voldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here 
I was ... ready-made.” 

He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for 
he smiled more warmly as he went on, “I am not 
complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it 
better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining 
their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having 
tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they 
have shunned normal society and live on the margins, 
stealing — and sometimes killing — to eat.” 

“How come they like Voldemort?” 

“They think that, under his rule, they will have a 
better life,” said Lupin. “And it is hard to argue with 
Grey back out there. ...” 

“Who’s Grey back?” 

“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed 
convulsively in his lap. “Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, 
the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as 
his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many 

Page | 376 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




people as possible; he wants to create enough 
werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has 
promised him prey in return for his services. 

Greyback specializes in children. ... Bite them young, 
he says, and raise them away from their parents, 
raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has 
threatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and 
daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good 
results.” 

Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who 
bit me.” 

“What?” said Harry, astonished. “When — when you 
were a kid, you mean?” 

“Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for 
a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had 
attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he 
had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to 
transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full 
moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring 
that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And 
this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the 
werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular 
brand of reasoned argument is making much 
headway against Greyback’s insistence that we 
werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge 
ourselves on normal people.” 

“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just 
got a — a problem — ” 

Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me 
a lot of James. He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in 
company. Many people were under the impression 
that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.” 



Page | 377 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with 
a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. 
Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last 
mention of his father had reminded him that there 
was something he had been looking forward to asking 
Lupin. 

“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half- 
Blood Prince?” 

“The Half-Blood what?” 

“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of 
recognition. 

“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now 
smiling. “Is this a title you’re thinking of adopting? I 
should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be 
enough.” 

“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. 
“The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to 
Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book. He wrote 
spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was 
Levicorpus — ” 

“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at 
Hogwarts,” said Lupin reminiscently. “There were a 
few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move 
for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.” 

“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the 
Pensieve, he used it on Snape.” 

He tried to sound casual, as though this was a 
throwaway comment of no real importance, but he 
was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s 
smile was a little too understanding. 



Page | 378 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it 
was very popular. ... You know how these spells come 
and go. ...” 

“But it sounds like it was invented while you were at 
school,” Harry persisted. 

“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of 
fashion like everything else.” 

He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, 
“James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, 
he never asked us to call him ‘Prince.’ ” 

Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t 
Sirius? Or you?” 

“Definitely not.” 

“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — 
well, he’s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the 
Prince has.” 

“How old is this book, Harry?” 

“I dunno, I’ve never checked.” 

“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when 
the Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin. 

Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina 
singing “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which 
was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. 
Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. 

Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic 
bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for 
Harry. 



Page | 379 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved 
into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced 
Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned 
its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the 
front of the book, the date that it had been published. 
It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his 
father’s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. 
Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into 
his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, 
thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike 
and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an 
uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of 
bitten children. ... 

“She’s got to be joking. ...” 

Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking 
lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses 
and looked around; the tiny window was almost 
completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron 
was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what 
appeared to be a thick gold chain. 

“What’s that?” asked Harry. 

“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted. 

“She can’t honestly think I’d wear ...” 

Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of 
laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters 
were the words: 

My Sweetheart 

“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should definitely wear it 
in front of Fred and George.” 



Page | 380 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out 
of sight under his pillow, “I — I — 111 — ” 

“Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning. “Come on, 
would I?” 

“How could she think I’d like something like that, 
though?” Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather 
shocked. 

“Well, think back,” said Harry. “Have you ever let it 
slip that you’d like to go out in public with the words 
‘My Sweetheart’ round your neck?” 

“Well ... we don’t really talk much,” said Ron. “It’s 
mainly ...” 

“Snogging,” said Harry. 

“Well, yeah,” said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then 
said, “Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?” 

“I dunno,” said Harry. “They were at Slughorn’s party 
together, but I don’t think it went that well.” 

Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper 
into his stocking. 

Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large 
Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by 
Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wizard 
Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly 
damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label 
reading TO MASTER, FROM KREACHER. 

Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” 
he asked. 



Page | 381 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still 
being searched at the Ministry,” replied Ron, though 
he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. 

“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people 
usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?” 
asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously. 

“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see 
what it is before you start feeling guilty.” 

A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt 
out of his camp bed; the package contained a large 
number of maggots. 

“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very 
thoughtful.” 

“I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, 
which sobered Ron up at once. 

Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all 
sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur 
(on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted 
to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was 
sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat 
glittering with what looked like tiny starlike 
diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace. 

“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they 
beautiful?” 

“Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, 
Mum, now we’re washing our own socks,” said 
George, waving an airy hand. “Parsnips, Remus?” 

“Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny 
cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; 



Page | 382 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had 
nothing to do with the maggot. 

“ ’Ow ’orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little 
shudder. 

“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?” 

In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy 
boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared 
up in the air and returned meekly to the boat. 

“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, 
when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. “She is 
always knocking — ” 

“I invited dear Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. 
Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary 
force and glaring at Fleur. “But she wouldn’t come. 
Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?” 

“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very 
much,” said Lupin. “But Tonks has got her own 
family to go to, hasn’t she?” 

“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the 
impression she was planning to spend Christmas 
alone, actually.” 

She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all 
his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law 
instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, 
who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own 
fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long- 
lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question 
he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask 
than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses? 



Page | 383 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. 
“Snape said so anyway. I didn’t know that could 
happen. Why would your Patronus change?” 

Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and 
swallowing before saying slowly, “Sometimes ... a 
great shock ... an emotional upheaval ...” 

“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, 
struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. 
“Hey ... it couldn’t be — ?” 

“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen 
from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart 
and she was staring out of the kitchen window. 
“Arthur — it’s Percy!” 

“What?” 

Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly 
at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. 

There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding 
across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses 
glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone. 

“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!” 

And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the 
Daily Prophet was following along in Percy’s wake, 
limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his 
black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of them 
could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley 
could do more than exchange stunned looks, the back 
door opened and there stood Percy. 

There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Percy 
said rather stiffly, “Merry Christmas, Mother.” 



Page | 384 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, Percy\” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself 
into his arms. 



Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on 
his walking stick and smiling as he observed this 
affecting scene. 

“You must forgive this intrusion,” he said, when Mrs. 
Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping 
her eyes. “Percy and I were in the vicinity — working, 
you know — and he couldn’t resist dropping in and 
seeing you all.” 

But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of 
the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and 
awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else’s 
heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all 
observing him, stony-faced. 

“Please, come in, sit down, Minister!” fluttered Mrs. 
Weasley, straightening her hat. “Have a little purkey, 
or some tooding. ... I mean — ” 

“No, no, my dear Molly,” said Scrimgeour. Harry 
guessed that he had checked her name with Percy 
before they entered the house. “I don’t want to 
intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t wanted 
to see you all so badly. ...” 

“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up 
to kiss him. 

"... We’ve only looked in for five minutes, so I’ll have a 
stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. 
No, no, I assure you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if 
anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . 
Ah, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t he take a 
stroll with me?” 

Page | 385 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The atmosphere around the table changed 
perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to 
Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense 
that he did not know Harry’s name convincing, or find 
it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the 
Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and 
George also had clean plates. 

“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence. 

He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they 
had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look 
up his family, this must be the real reason that they 
had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry 
alone. 

“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who 
had half risen from his chair. “Fine,” he added, as Mr. 
Weasley opened his mouth to speak. 

“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let 
Harry pass through the door ahead of him. “We’ll just 
take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I’ll be 
off. Carry on, everyone!” 

Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys’ 
overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping 
slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of 
the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, 
very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat. 

“Charming,” said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden 
fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the 
indistinguishable plants. “Charming.” 

Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was 
watching him. 



Page | 386 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said 
Scrimgeour, after a few moments. “Did you know 
that?” 

“No,” said Harry truthfully. 

“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has 
been very protective of you,” said Scrimgeour. 
“Natural, of course, natural, after what you’ve been 
through. ... Especially what happened at the Ministry 



He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did 
not oblige, so he went on, “I have been hoping for an 
occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but 
Dumbledore has — most understandably, as I say — 
prevented this.” 

Still, Harry said nothing, waiting. 

“The rumors that have flown around!” said 
Scrimgeour. “Well, of course, we both know how these 
stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a 
prophecy ... of you being ‘the Chosen One’...” 

They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the 
reason Scrimgeour was here. 

"... I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these 
matters with you?” 

Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie 
or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around 
the flowerbeds, and the scuffed-up patch that marked 
the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now 
wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. 
Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it. 

“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.” 

Page | 387 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Have you, have you ...” said Scrimgeour. Harry could 
see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting 
at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a 
gnome that had just poked its head out from 
underneath a frozen rhododendron. “And what has 
Dumbledore told you, Harry?” 

“Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry. He kept 
his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour’s 
tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, “Oh, of 
course, if it’s a question of confidences, I wouldn’t 
want you to divulge ... no, no ... and in any case, does 
it really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One’ or 
not?” ” 

Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds 
before responding. “I don’t really know what you 
mean, Minister.” 

“Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,” 
said Scrimgeour with a laugh. “But to the Wizarding 
community at large ... it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s 
what people believe that’s important.” 

Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where 
they were heading, but he was not going to help 
Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the 
rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, 
and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. 

“People believe you are ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” 
said Scrimgeour. “They think you quite the hero — 
which, of course, you are, Harry, chosen or not! How 
many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named now? Well, anyway,” he pressed on, without 
waiting for a reply, “the point is, you are a symbol of 
hope for many, Harry. The idea that there is 
somebody out there who might be able, who might 
even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Page | 388 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Named — well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I 
can’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you 
might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand 
alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.” 

The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It 
was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of 
the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that 
Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, 
“Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you, 
Harry?” 

“I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said 
Harry slowly. “ ‘Stand alongside the Ministry’ ... What 
does that mean?” 

“Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,” said 
Scrimgeour. “If you were to be seen popping in and 
out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, 
that would give the right impression. And of course, 
while you were there, you would have ample 
opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my 
successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores 
Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition 
to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very 
easily. ...” 

Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So 
Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she? 

“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to 
clarify a few points, “you’d like to give the impression 
that I’m working for the Ministry?” 

“It would give everyone a lift to think you were more 
involved, Harry,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved 
that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. “ The Chosen 
One,’ you know ... It’s all about giving people hope, 
the feeling that exciting things are happening. ...” 
Page | 389 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” 
said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, 
“won’t that seem as though I approve of what the 
Ministry’s up to?” 

“Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, 
that’s partly why we’d like — ” 

“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly. 
“You see, I don’t like some of the things the Ministry’s 
doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.” 

Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his 
expression hardened instantly. “I would not expect 
you to understand,” he said, and he was not as 
successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry 
had been. “These are dangerous times, and certain 
measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old 



“Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t 
think Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said Harry. 
“You’re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want 
to make me a mascot.” 

They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally 
Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, “I see. 
You prefer — like your hero, Dumbledore — to 
disassociate yourself from the Ministry?” 

“I don’t want to be used,” said Harry. 

“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the 
Ministry!” 

“Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check 
that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck 
them in prison,” said Harry, his temper rising now. 
“You’re doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it 

Page | 390 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




right, you people, do you? Either we’ve got Fudge, 
pretending everything’s lovely while people get 
murdered right under his nose, or we’ve got you, 
chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to 
pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!” 

“So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour. 

“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said 
Harry, with a bitter laugh. “Not to you anyway.” 

“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly. 
“It was tactless — ” 

“No, it was honest,” said Harry. “One of the only 
honest things you’ve said to me. You don’t care 
whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you 
convince everyone you’re winning the war against 
Voldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister. ...” 

He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the 
back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores 
Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: / 
must not tell lies. 

“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I 
was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The 
Ministry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.” 

They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath 
their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate 
his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning 
against the bottommost branches of the 
rhododendron bush. 

“What is Dumbledore up to?” said Scrimgeour 
brusquely. “Where does he go when he is absent from 
Hogwarts?” 



Page | 391 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No idea,” said Harry. 

“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said 
Scrimgeour, “would you?” 

“No, I wouldn’t,” said Harry. 

“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out 
by other means.” 

“You can try,” said Harry indifferently. “But you seem 
cleverer than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have 
learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at 
Hogwarts. You might have noticed he’s not Minister 
anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d leave 
Dumbledore alone, if I were you.” 

There was a long pause. 

“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good 
job on you,” said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard 
behind his wire-rimmed glasses. “Dumbledore’s man 
through and through, aren’t you, Potter?” 

“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that 
out.” 

And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he 
strode back toward the house.

A SLUGGISH MEMORY 

Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, 
Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen 
fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged 
this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return 
students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. 
Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, 
Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. 
Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. 
Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she 
had been crying on and off ever since Percy had 
stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his 
glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which 
Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit). 

“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back 
as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. “It’s okay. 



“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his 
mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or 



Page | 393 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



about Percy. He’s such a prat, it’s not really a loss, is 
it?” 



Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she 
enfolded Harry in her arms. 

“Promise me you’ll look after yourself. ... Stay out of 
trouble. ...” 

“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet 
life, you know me.” 

She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, 
then, all of you. ...” 

Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted 
“Hogwarts!” He had one last fleeting view of the 
Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. Weasley’s tearful face 
before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he 
caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, 
which were whipped out of sight before he could get a 
proper look; then he was slowing down, finally 
stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor 
McGonagall’s office. She barely glanced up from her 
work as he clambered out over the grate. 

“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the 
carpet.” 

“No, Professor.” 

Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair 
as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had 
arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall’s 
office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced 
out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun 
was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper 
snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the 



Page | 394 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in 
front of his cabin. 



“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached 
the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than 
usual and winced at his loud voice. 

“No,” she said. 

“What d’you mean, ‘no’?” 

“There is a new password,” she said. “And please 
don’t shout.” 

“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?” 
“Harry! Ginny!” 

Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced 
and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves. 

“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down 
to visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she 
said breathlessly. “Did you have a good Christmas?” 

“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus 
Scrim — ” 

“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, 
neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she 
had heard him. “Oh, hang on — password. 
Abstinence.” 

“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and 
swung forward to reveal the portrait hole. 

“What’s up with her?” asked Harry. 



Page | 395 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said 
Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the 
packed common room. “She and her friend Violet 
drank their way through all the wine in that picture of 
drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anyway 



She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then 
pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore’s 
writing on it. 

“Great,” said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover 
that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled 
for the following night. “I’ve got loads to tell him — 
and you. Let’s sit down — ” 

But at that moment there was a loud squeal of “Won- 
Won!” and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of 
nowhere and flung herself into Ron’s arms. Several 
onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh 
and said, “There’s a table over here. ... Coming, 
Ginny?” 

“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, 
though Harry could not help noticing that she did not 
sound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Lavender 
locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, Harry led 
Hermione over to the spare table. 

“So how was your Christmas?” 

“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Nothing special. How was it 
at Won-Won’s?” 

“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry. “Look, 

Hermione, can’t you — ?” 

“No, I can’t,” she said flatly. “So don’t even ask.” 



Page | 396 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas — ” 



“It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred- 
year- old wine, Harry, not me. So what was this 
important news you wanted to tell me?” 

She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so 
Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all 
that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. 
When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a 
moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?” 

“ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could 
trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing?” 

“Well, yes,” said Hermione. 

“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said 
grudgingly. “But this definitely proves Malfoy’s 
planning something, you can’t deny that.” 

“No, I can’t,” she answered slowly. 

“And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I 
said!” 

“Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention 
Voldemort’s name?” 

Harry frowned, trying to remember. “I’m not sure ... 
Snape definitely said your master,’ and who else 
would that be?” 

“I don’t know,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “Maybe 
his father?” 

She stared across the room, apparently lost in 
thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. 
“How’s Lupin?” 

Page | 397 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Not great,” said Harry, and he told her all about 
Lupin’s mission among the werewolves and the 
difficulties he was facing. “Have you heard of this 
Fenrir Grey back?” 

“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sounding startled. “And 
so have you, Harry!” 

“When, History of Magic? You know full well I never 
listened ...” 

“No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened 
Borgin with him!” said Hermione. “Back in Knockturn 
Alley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that 
Grey back was an old family friend and that he’d be 
checking up on Borgin’s progress!” 

Harry gaped at her. “I forgot! But this proves Malfoy’s 
a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with 
Greyback and telling him what to do?” 

“It is pretty suspicious,” breathed Hermione. “Unless 



“Oh, come on,” said Harry in exasperation, “you can’t 
get round this one!” 

“Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty 
threat.” 

“You’re unbelievable, you are,” said Harry, shaking 
his head. “We’ll see who’s right. ... You’ll be eating 
your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh 
yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. ...” 

And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both 
of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, 
like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put 



Page | 398 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry through the previous year, they had a great 
deal of nerve asking him for help now. 

The new term started next morning with a pleasant 
surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been 
pinned to the common room notice boards overnight. 

APPARITION LESSONS 

If you are seventeen years of age, or will turn 
seventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are 
eligible for a twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons 
from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor. Please 
sign below if you would like to participate. Cost: 12 
Galleons. 

Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling 
around the notice and taking it in turns to write their 
names at the bottom. Ron was just taking out his 
quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up 
behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and 
trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry turned to see 
Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having 
no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to 
his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little 
way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and 
his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione 
sped up to walk with Neville. 

“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it 
perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what 
had just happened. “Should be a laugh, eh?” 

“I dunno,” said Harry. “Maybe it’s better when you do 
it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore 
took me along for the ride.” 



Page | 399 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I forgot you’d already done it. ... I’d better pass my 
test first time,” said Ron, looking anxious. “Fred and 
George did.” 

“Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?” 

“Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his 
arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla — 
“so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much ... not 
to his face anyway ...” 

“When can we take the actual test?” 

“Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me!” 

“Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, 
not in the castle ...” 

“Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could 
Apparate if I wanted.” 

Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect 
of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about 
the forthcoming lessons; a great deal of store was set 
by being able to vanish and reappear at will. 

“How cool will it be when we can just — ” Seamus 
clicked his fingers to indicate disappearance. “Me 
cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I 
can do it back ... He’ll never have another peaceful 
moment. ...” 

Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his 
wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of 
producing the fountain of pure water that was the 
object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike 
jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked 
Professor Flitwick flat on his face. 



Page | 400 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly 
abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried 
himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus 
lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a 
stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him. Side-Along- 
Apparition, you know.” 

“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and 
Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what 
Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was 
besieged with requests from the other sixth years to 
describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them 
seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them 
how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering 
detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when 
he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return 
a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his 
lesson with Dumbledore. 

The lamps in Dumbledore ’s office were lit, the 
portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently 
in their frames, and the Pensieve was ready upon the 
desk once more. Dumbledore ’s hands lay on either 
side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt- 
looking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all 
and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, 
what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did 
not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know 
eventually and there was, in any case, another 
subject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could 
say anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore 
spoke. 

“I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over 
Christmas?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s not very happy with me.” 



Page | 401 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“No,” sighed Dumbledore. “He is not very happy with 
me either. We must try not to sink beneath our 
anguish, Harry, but battle on.” 

Harry grinned. 

“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that 
the Ministry’s doing a wonderful job.” 

Dumbledore smiled. 

“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his 
last days in office, when he was trying desperately to 
cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, 
hoping that you would give him your support — ” 

“After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry 
angrily. “After Umbridge?” 

“I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the 
idea did not die when he left office. Within hours of 
Scrimgeour’s appointment we met and he demanded 
that I arrange a meeting with you — ” 

“So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out. “It was 
in the Daily Prophet” 

“The Prophet is bound to report the truth 
occasionally,” said Dumbledore, “if only accidentally. 
Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that 
Rufus found a way to corner you at last.” 

“He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore ’s man through 
and through.’ ” 

“How very rude of him.” 

“I told him I was.” 



Page | 402 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then 
closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let 
out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry’s intense 
embarrassment, he suddenly realized that 
Dumbledore ’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, 
and stared hastily at his own knees. When 
Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite 
steady. 

“I am very touched, Harry.” 

“Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when 
you’re not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, still looking 
fixedly at his knees. 

“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, 
now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to 
look up again. “He has even attempted to have me 
followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It 
wasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx 
Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.” 

“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, 
hoping for more information on this intriguing 
subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top 
of his half-moon spectacles. 

“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you 
to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless 
there’s anything else — ?” 

“There is, actually, sir,” said Harry. “It’s about Malfoy 
and Snape.” 

“Professor Snape, Harry.” 

“Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor 
Slughorn’s party ... well, I followed them, actually. ...” 



Page | 403 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore listened to Harry’s story with an 
impassive face. When Harry had finished he did not 
speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for 
telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it 
out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great 
importance.” 

“Not of great importance?” repeated Harry 
incredulously. “Professor, did you understand — ?” 

“Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary 
brainpower, I understood everything you told me,” 
said Dumbledore, a little sharply. “I think you might 
even consider the possibility that I understood more 
than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided 
in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told 
me anything that causes me disquiet.” 

Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. 
What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore 
had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy 
was doing, in which case he had already heard 
everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or 
was he really worried by what he had heard, but 
pretending not to be? 

“So, sir,” said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, 
calm voice, “you definitely still trust — ?” 

“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question 
already,” said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very 
tolerant anymore. “My answer has not changed.” 

“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas 
Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. 
Dumbledore ignored him.

“And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I 
have more important things to discuss with you this 
evening.” 

Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if 
he refused to permit the change of subject, if he 
insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As 
though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore shook 
his head. 

“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the 
best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has 
to say is much more important than anything the 
other might have to contribute!” 

“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, 
sir,” said Harry stiffly. 

“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said 
Dumbledore briskly. “I have two more memories to 
show you this evening, both obtained with enormous 
difficulty, and the second of them is, I think, the most 
important I have collected.” 

Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry 
at the reception his confidences had received, but 
could not see what was to be gained by arguing 
further. 

“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet 
this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom 
we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years 
at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was 
to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my 
company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, 
warned him against continued thievery when he 
arrived at school.

“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it 
came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand 
robes, who lined up with the other first years to be 
sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the 
moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” 
continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand 
toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat 
sat, ancient and unmoving. “How soon Riddle learned 
that the famous founder of the House could talk to 
snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. 
The knowledge can only have excited him and 
increased his sense of self-importance. 

“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow 
Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their 
common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He 
showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at 
all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking 
orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy 
from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. 
He seemed polite, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. 
Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.” 

“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when 
you met him at the orphanage?” asked Harry. 

“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of 
remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he 
had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a 
fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.” 

Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, 
who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was 
Dumbledore ’s tendency to trust people in spite of 
overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! 
But then Harry remembered something. . . . 

“But you didn’t really trust him, sir, did you? He told 
me . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said, 

Page | 406 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




‘Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the 
other teachers did.’ ” 

“Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he 
was trustworthy,” said Dumbledore. “I had, as I have 
already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon 
him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a 
great deal from my observations at first. He was very 
guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill 
of discovering his true identity he had told me a little 
too much. He was careful never to reveal as much 
again, but he could not take back what he had let slip 
in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in 
me. However, he had the sense never to try and 
charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues. 

“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a 
group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want 
of a better term, although as I have already indicated, 
Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. 
This group had a kind of dark glamour within the 
castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the 
weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some 
shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a 
leader who could show them more refined forms of 
cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of 
the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became 
the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts. 

“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected 
in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at 
Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty 
incidents to which they were never satisfactorily 
linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the 
opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in 
the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly 
accused of that crime. 



Page | 407 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle 
at Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore, placing his withered 
hand on the Pensieve. “Few who knew him then are 
prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. 
What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, 
after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few 
who could be tricked into speaking, after searching 
old records and questioning Muggle and wizard 
witnesses alike. 

“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that 
Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is 
understandable, of course; he had grown up in an 
orphanage and naturally wished to know how he 
came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain 
for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in 
the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old 
school records, even in the books of Wizarding 
history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father 
had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was 
then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the 
identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his 
investigations into his previously despised mother’s 
family — the woman whom, you will remember, he 
had thought could not be a witch if she had 
succumbed to the shameful human weakness of 
death. 

“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ 
which he knew from those who ran the orphanage 
had been his mother’s father’s name. Finally, after 
painstaking research through old books of Wizarding 
families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s 
surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he 
left the orphanage to which he returned annually and 
set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if 
you will stand ...” 



Page | 408 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again 
holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling, 
pearly memory. 

“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he 
poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. “As you 
will understand when we have experienced it. Shall 
we?” 

Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed 
obediently until his face sank through the surface of 
the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling 
through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty 
stone floor in almost total darkness. 

It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by 
which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The 
Gaunts’ house was now more indescribably filthy 
than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was 
thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy 
and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of 
crusted pots. The only light came from a single 
guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair 
and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes 
nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the 
fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he 
was dead. But then there came a loud knock on the 
door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his 
right hand and a short knife in his left. 

The door creaked open. There on the threshold, 
holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry 
recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and 
handsome — the teenage Voldemort. 

Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and 
then found the man in the armchair. For a few 
seconds they looked at each other, then the man 



Page | 409 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet 
clattering and tinkling across the floor. 

“YOU!” he bellowed. “YOU!” 

And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife 
held aloft. 

“Stop.” 

Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into 
the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He 
stared at Riddle. There was a long silence while they 
contemplated each other. The man broke it. 

“ You speak it?” 

“Yes, I speak it,” said Riddle. He moved forward into 
the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind 
him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful 
admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of fear. His 
face merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, 
disappointment. 

“Where is Marvolo?” he asked. 

“Dead,” said the other. “Died years ago, didn’t he?” 
Riddle frowned. 

“ Who are you, then?” 

“I’m Morfin, ain’t 1?” 

“ Marvolo’ s son?” 

“ ’Course I am, then ...” 



Page | 410 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better 
to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo’s 
black-stoned ring on his right hand. 

“I thought you was that Muggle,” whispered Morfin. 

“ You look mighty like that Muggle .” 

“What Muggle?” said Riddle sharply. 

“That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that 
Muggle what lives in the big house over the way,” said 
Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor 
between them. “You look right like him. Riddle. But 
he’s older now, in ’e? He’s older’n you, now I think on 
it. ...” 

Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still 
clutching the edge of the table for support. “He come 
back, see,” he added stupidly. 

Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising 
his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and 
said, “Riddle came back?” 

“Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth\” 
said Morfin, spitting on the floor again. “Robbed us, 
mind, before she ran off! Where’s the locket, eh, 
where’s Slytherin’s locket?” 

Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working 
himself into a rage again; he brandished his knife and 
shouted, “Dishonored us, she did, that little slut! And 
who’re you, coming here and asking questions about 
all that? It’s over, innit. ... It’s over. ...” 

He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort 
moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness 
fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin ’s 
candle, extinguishing everything. ... 

Page | 411 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around Harry’s 
arm and they were soaring back into the present 
again. The soft golden light in Dumbledore’s office 
seemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that impenetrable 
darkness. 

“Is that all?” said Harry at once. “Why did it go dark, 
what happened?” 

“Because Morfin could not remember anything from 
that point onward,” said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry 
back into his seat. “When he awoke next morning, he 
was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvolo’s ring had 
gone. 

“Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid 
was running along the High Street, screaming that 
there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of 
the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and 
father. 

“The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I 
am aware, they do not know to this day how the 
Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not 
usually leave any sign of damage. ... The exception 
sits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to 
Harry’s scar. “The Ministry, on the other hand, knew 
at once that this was a wizard’s murder. They also 
knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the 
valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had 
already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the 
murdered people. 

“So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not 
need to question him, to use Veritaserum or 
Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, 
giving details only the murderer could know. He was 
proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been 
awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over 
Page | 412 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




his wand, which was proved at once to have been 
used to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to 
be led off to Azkaban without a fight. All that 
disturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had 
disappeared. ‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his 
captors over and over again. ‘He’ll kill me for losing 
his ring. ’ And that, apparently, was all he ever said 
again. He lived out the remainder of his life in 
Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last 
heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside 
the other poor souls who have expired within its 
walls.” 

“So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said 
Harry, sitting up straight. 

“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no 
memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly 
sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, 
took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to ‘the 
big house over the way. ’ There he murdered the 
Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, 
and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, 
thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line 
and revenging himself upon the father who never 
wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, 
performed the complex bit of magic that would 
implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind, laid 
Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, 
pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.” 

“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?” 

“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full 
and boastful confession.” 

“But he had this real memory in him all the time!” 



Page | 413 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to 
coax it out of him,” said Dumbledore, “and why 
should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind 
when he had already confessed to the crime? 

However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the 
last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting 
to discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s 
past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I 
saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure 
Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry 
reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.” 

“But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that 
Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked 
angrily. “He was underage at the time, wasn’t he? I 
thought they could detect underage magic!” 

“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not 
the perpetrator: You will remember that you were 
blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, 
in fact, cast by — ” 

“Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. 

“So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an 
adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t 
know?” 

“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed 
the magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the 
look of great indignation on Harry’s face. “They rely 
on witch and wizard parents to enforce their 
offspring’s obedience while within their walls.” 

“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what 
happened here, look what happened to Morfin!” 

“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he 
did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders 



Page | 414 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I 
want you to see this other memory before we part. ...” 



Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another 
crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, 
remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the 
most important one he had collected. Harry noticed 
that the contents proved difficult to empty into the 
Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did 
memories go bad? 

“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he 
had finally emptied the phial. “We shall be back 
before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then 



And Harry fell again through the silver surface, 
landing this time right in front of a man he recognized 
at once. 

It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was 
so used to him bald that he found the sight of 
Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite 
disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his 
head thatched, though there was already a shiny 
Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, 
less massive than it was these days, was gingery- 
blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn 
Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly 
embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of 
strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he 
was sitting well back in a comfortable winged 
armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, 
the other searching through a box of crystalized 
pineapple. 

Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside 
him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn ’s 
office. Half a dozen boys were sitting around 

Page | 415 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and 
all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at 
once. His was the most handsome face and he looked 
the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay 
negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, 
Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s gold-and- 
black ring; he had already killed his father. 

“Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is 
retiring?” he asked. 

“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said 
Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger 
at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by 
winking. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get 
your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half 
the staff, you are.” 

Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him 
admiring looks. 

“What with your uncanny ability to know things you 
shouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the people who 
matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, 
you’re quite right, it is my favorite — ” 

As several of the boys tittered, something very odd 
happened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a 
thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but 
the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside 
him. Then Slughorn ’s voice rang out through the 
mist, unnaturally loudly, “ You’ll go wrong, boy, mark 
my words.” 

The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and 
yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody 
look as though anything unusual had just happened. 
Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden 



Page | 416 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven 
o’clock. 

“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said 
Slughorn. “You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be 
in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow 
or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.” 

Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and 
carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys 
filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry 
could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be 
last in the room with Slughorn. 

“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turning around 
and finding him still present. “You don’t want to be 
caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...” 

“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.” 

“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. ...” 

“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about 
Horcruxes?” 

And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled 
the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or 
Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely 
beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice boomed out again, 
just as it had done before. 

“I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t 
tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don’t 
let me catch you mentioning them again\” 

“Well, that’s that,” said Dumbledore placidly beside 
Harry. “Time to go.” 



Page | 417 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And Harry’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, 
back onto the mg in front of Dumbledore’s desk. 



“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly. 

Dumbledore had said that this was the most 
important memory of all, but he could not see what 
was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and 
the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was 
odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have 
happened except that Voldemort had asked a 
question and failed to get an answer. 

“As you might have noticed,” said Dumbledore, 
reseating himself behind his desk, “that memory has 
been tampered with.” 

“Tampered with?” repeated Harry, sitting back down 
too. 

“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Professor Slughorn 
has meddled with his own recollections.” 

“But why would he do that?” 

“Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he 
remembers,” said Dumbledore. “He has tried to 
rework the memory to show himself in a better light, 
obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to 
see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, 
and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true 
memory is still there beneath the alterations. 

“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, 
Harry. It will be your job to persuade Professor 
Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will 
undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information 
of all.” 

Page | 418 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry stared at him. 

“But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as 
respectful as possible, “you don’t need me — you 
could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ...” 

“Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who 
will be expecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is 
much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor 
Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has 
not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever 
since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a 
recollection. 

“No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the 
truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do 
much more harm than good; I do not wish him to 
leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like 
the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one 
person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It 
is most important that we secure the true memory, 
Harry. ... How important, we will only know when we 
have seen the real thing. So, good luck ... and good 
night.” 

A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry 
got to his feet quickly. “Good night, sir.” 

As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly 
heard Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy 
should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.” 

“I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied 
Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical 
cry.

BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 

The next day Harry confided in both Ron and 
Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, 
though separately, for Hermione still refused to 
remain in Ron’s presence longer than it took to give 
him a contemptuous look. 

Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any 
trouble with Slughorn at all. 

“He loves you,” he said over breakfast, waving an airy 
forkful of fried egg. “Won’t refuse you anything, will 
he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after 
class this afternoon and ask him.” 

Hermione, however, took a gloomier view. “He must 
be determined to hide what really happened if 
Dumbledore couldn’t get it out of him,” she said in a 
low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy 
courtyard at break. “Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I’ve 
never even heard of them. ...” 



Page | 420 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“You haven’t?” Harry was disappointed; he had hoped 
that Hermione might have been able to give him a 
clue as to what Horcruxes were. 



“They must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why 
would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I 
think it’s going to be difficult to get the information, 
Harry, you’ll have to be very careful about how you 
approach Slughorn, think out a strategy. ...” 

“Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions 
this afternoon. ...” 

“Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you’d better do it,” 
she said, flaring up at once. “After all, when has Won- 
Won’s judgment ever been faulty?” 

“Hermione, can’t you — ?” 

“iVo!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving 
Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow. 

Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these 
days, seeing as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to 
share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron 
around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and 
ignored both Harry and Ron. 

“What’ve you done?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking 
at Hermione ’s haughty profile. 

But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling 
for silence from the front of the room. 

“Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots 
of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott’s 
Third Law ... who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger 
can, of course!” 

Page | 421 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione recited at top speed: “Golpalott’s-Third- 
Law-states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison- 
will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes- 
for-each-of-the-separate-components.” 

“Precisely!” beamed Slughorn. “Ten points for 
Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott’s Third Law as 
true ...” 

Harry was going to have to take Slughorn ’s word for it 
that Golpalott’s Third Law was true, because he had 
not understood any of it. Nobody apart from 
Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said 
next either. 

"... which means, of course, that assuming we have 
achieved correct identification of the potion’s 
ingredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our primary aim 
is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes 
to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find 
that added component that will, by an almost 
alchemical process, transform these disparate 
elements — ” 

Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half 
open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced 
Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no 
longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble 
when he failed to grasp what was going on. 

"... and so,” finished Slughorn, “I want each of you to 
come and take one of these phials from my desk. You 
are to create an antidote for the poison within it 
before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don’t 
forget your protective gloves!” 

Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward 
Slughorn ’s desk before the rest of the class had 
realized it was time to move, and by the time Harry, 

Page | 422 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron, and Ernie returned to the table, she had already 
tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and 
was kindling a fire underneath it. 

“It’s a shame that the Prince won’t be able to help you 
much with this, Harry,” she said brightly as she 
straightened up. “You have to understand the 
principles involved this time. No shortcuts or cheats!” 

Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken 
from Slughorn’s desk, which was a garish shade of 
pink, tipped it into his cauldron, and lit a fire 
underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what 
he was supposed to do next. He glanced around at 
Ron, who was now standing there looking rather 
gormless, having copied everything Harry had done. 

“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” Ron 
muttered to Harry. 

Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion- 
Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There 
was Golpalott’s Third Law, stated word for word as 
Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating 
note in the Prince’s hand to explain what it meant. 
Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no 
difficulty understanding it. 

“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily. 

Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically 
over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy 
the spell she was doing because she was now so good 
at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say 
the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was 
muttering, “Specialis Reveliol” over his cauldron, 
which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron 
hastened to imitate him. 



Page | 423 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his 
reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was 
crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered 
hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the 
dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he 
usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head 
hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs 
overwhelmed him. Hermione’s expression could not 
have been any smugger; she had loathed being 
outperformed in every Potions class. She was now 
decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of 
her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to 
avoid watching this irritating sight than anything 
else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince’s book and 
turned a few pages with unnecessary force. 

And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of 
antidotes: 

Just shove a bezoar down their throats. 

Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn’t he 
once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn’t Snape 
mentioned them in their first-ever Potions lesson? “A 
stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will 
protect from most poisons.” 

It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and 
had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not 
have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate 
measures. He hastened toward the store cupboard 
and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn 
horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at 
the very back, a small cardboard box on which had 
been scribbled the word bezoars. 

He opened the box just as Slughorn called, “Two 
minutes left, everyone!” Inside were half a dozen 



Page | 424 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




shriveled brown objects, looking more like dried-up 
kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the 
box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to his 
cauldron. 

“Time’s ... UP!” called Slughorn genially. “Well, let’s 
see how you’ve done! Blaise ... what have you got for 
me?” 

Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining 
the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, 
although Hermione was trying to cram a few more 
ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached 
her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely 
trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing 
from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the 
bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. 

Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie’s 
potion and passed on to Ron’s with a grimace. He did 
not linger over Ron’s cauldron, but backed away 
swiftly, retching slightly. 

“And you, Harry,” he said. “What have you got to 
show me?” 

Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his 
palm. 

Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. 
Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going 
to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and 
roared with laughter. 

“You’ve got nerve, boy!” he boomed, taking the bezoar 
and holding it up so that the class could see it. “Oh, 
you’re like your mother. ... Well, I can’t fault you. ... A 
bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these 
potions!” 

Page | 425 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her 
nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, 
comprising fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of 
her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, 
who had eyes for nobody but Harry. 

“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, 
Harry?” she asked through gritted teeth. 

“That’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker 
needs!” said Slughorn happily, before Harry could 
reply. “Just like his mother, she had the same 
intuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s undoubtedly 
from Lily he gets it. ... Yes, Harry, yes, if you’ve got a 
bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . 
although as they don’t work on everything, and are 
pretty rare, it’s still worth knowing how to mix 
antidotes. ...” 

The only person in the room looking angrier than 
Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, 
had spilled something that looked like cat-sick over 
himself. Before either of them could express their fury 
that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any 
work, however, the bell rang. 

“Time to pack up!” said Slughorn. “And an extra ten 
points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!” 

Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the 
front of the dungeon. 

Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount 
of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione 
wished him luck as they left; both looked rather 
annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only 
two left in the room. 



Page | 426 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Come on, now, Harry, you’ll be late for your next 
lesson,” said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold 
clasps shut on his dragon- skin briefcase. 

“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of 
Voldemort, “I wanted to ask you something.” 

“Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away. ...” 

“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about 
Horcruxes?” 

Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in 
upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, 

“What did you say?” 

“I asked whether you know anything about 
Horcruxes, sir. You see — ” 

“Dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered 
Slughorn. His voice had changed completely. It was 
not genial anymore, but shocked, terrified. He 
fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a 
handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. 
“Dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory. Well? 
Hasn’t he?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was 
best not to lie. 

“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing 
at his white face. “Of course ... well, if you’ve seen 
that memory, Harry, you’ll know that I don’t know 
anything — anything” — he repeated the word 
forcefully — “about Horcruxes.” 

He seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his 
handkerchief back into his pocket, and marched to 
the dungeon door. 

Page | 427 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sir,” said Harry desperately, “I just thought there 
might be a bit more to the memory — ” 

“Did you?” said Slughorn. “Then you were wrong, 
weren’t you? WRONG!” 

He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say 
another word, slammed the dungeon door behind 
him. 

Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic 
when Harry told them of this disastrous interview. 
Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had 
triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was 
resentful that Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too. 

“It would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it!” 
said Harry irritably. “Look, I had to try and soften him 
up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn’t I? Oh, 
will you get a grip\” he added in exasperation, as Ron 
winced at the sound of the name. 

Infuriated by his failure and by Ron’s and Hermione’s 
attitudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over 
what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for 
the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he 
had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best 
to lull him into a false sense of security before 
returning to the attack. 

When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the 
Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate 
treatment of him, and appeared to have put the 
matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to 
one of his little evening parties, determined to accept 
this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch 
practice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation 
arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: 
Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as 
Page | 428 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not 
help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn 
was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply 
determined to give Harry no additional opportunities 
to question him. 

Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione 
for the first time in living memory. She was so 
shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at 
Harry for his trick with the bezoar. 

“I haven’t found one single explanation of what 
Horcruxes do!” she told him. “Not a single one! I’ve 
been right through the restricted section and even in 
the most horrible books, where they tell you how to 
brew the most gruesome potions — nothing! All I 
could find was this, in the introduction to Magick 
Moste Evile — listen — ‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of 
magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give 
direction. ...’I mean, why mention it then?” she said 
impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a 
ghostly wail. “Oh, shut up,” she snapped, stuffing it 
back into her bag. 

The snow melted around the school as February 
arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. 
Purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a 
constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery 
and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth 
years’ first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled 
for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons 
would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead 
of in the grounds. 

When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron 
had come down with Lavender), they found that the 
tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high 
windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly 
above them as they assembled in front of Professors 
Page | 429 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout — the 
Heads of Houses — and a small wizard whom Harry 
took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry. 
He was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, 
wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a 
single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry 
wondered whether constant disappearances and 
reappearances had somehow diminished his 
substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for 
anyone wishing to vanish. 

“Good morning,” said the Ministry wizard, when all 
the students had arrived and the Heads of Houses 
had called for quiet. “My name is Wilkie Twycross and 
I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the 
next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for 
your Apparition Tests in this time — ” 

“Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor 
McGonagall. 

Everybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull 
pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from 
Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having 
a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at 
Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry 
strongly suspected that this was less because of 
Malfoy’s rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had 
reprimanded one of his House. 

“ — by which time, many of you may be ready to take 
your tests,” Twycross continued, as though there had 
been no interruption. 

“As you may know, it is usually impossible to 
Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The 
headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely 
within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable 
you to practice. May I emphasize that you will not be 
Page | 430 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and 
that you would be unwise to try. 

“I would like each of you to place yourselves now so 
that you have a clear five feet of space in front of 
you.” 

There was a great scrambling and jostling as people 
separated, banged into each other, and ordered 
others out of their space. The Heads of Houses moved 
among the students, marshaling them into position 
and breaking up arguments. 

“Harry, where are you going?” demanded Hermione. 

But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly 
through the crowd, past the place where Professor 
Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a 
few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the 
front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the 
Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie 
Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at 
the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who 
was taking advantage of the general upheaval to 
continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet 
away and looking mutinous. 

“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” Malfoy 
shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind 
him. “It’s taking longer than I thought it would.” 

Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to 
second-guess what he was going to say. “Look, it’s 
none of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe, you 
and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout!” 

“I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to 
keep a lookout for me,” Harry said, just loud enough 
for Malfoy to hear him. 

Page | 431 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy spun around on the spot, his hand flying to 
his wand, but at that precise moment the four Heads 
of House shouted, “Quiet!” and silence fell again. 
Malfoy turned slowly to face the front again. 

“Thank you,” said Twycross. “Now then ...” 

He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops 
instantly appeared on the floor in front of every 
student. 

“The important things to remember when Apparating 
are the three D’s!” said Twycross. “Destination, 
Determination, Deliberation! 

“Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired 
destination,” said Twycross. “In this case, the interior 
of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that 
destination now.” 

Everybody looked around furtively to check that 
everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily 
did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular 
patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried 
hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, 
as he couldn’t stop puzzling over what Malfoy was 
doing that needed lookouts. 

“Step two,” said Twycross, “focus your determination 
to occupy the visualized space! Let your yearning to 
enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your 
body!” 

Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to 
his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop 
so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as 
though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. 
Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze 
to his own hoop. 

Page | 432 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Step three,” called Twycross, “and only when I give 
the command ... Turn on the spot, feeling your way 
into nothingness, moving with deliberation ,! On my 
command, now . . . one — ” 

Harry glanced around again; lots of people were 
looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate 
so quickly. 

“— two — ” 

Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he 
had already forgotten what the three D’s stood for. 

THREE!” 

Harry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell 
over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was 
suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on 
his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had 
done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and 
looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of 
Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him. 

“Never mind, never mind,” said Twycross dryly, who 
did not seem to have expected anything better. 

“Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original 
positions. ...” 

The second attempt was no better than the first. The 
third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did 
anything exciting happen. There was a horrible 
screech of pain and everybody looked around, 
terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in 
her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away 
where she had started. 

The Heads of House converged on her; there was a 
great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared 

Page | 433 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but 
looking horrified. 



“Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,” 
said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, “occurs when 
the mind is insufficiently determined. You must 
concentrate continuously upon your destination , and 
move, without haste, but with deliberation ... thus.” 

Twycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the 
spot with his arms outstretched, and vanished in a 
swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. 

“Remember the three D’s,” he said, “and try again ... 
one — two — three — ” 

But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the 
most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross 
did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his 
neck, he merely said, “Until next Saturday, 
everybody, and do not forget: Destination. 
Determination. Deliberation.” 

With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, 
and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor 
McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began 
moving toward the entrance hall. 

“How did you do?” asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry. 
“I think I felt something the last time I tried — a kind 
of tingling in my feet.” 

“I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,” said 
a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, 
smirking. 

“I didn’t feel anything,” said Harry, ignoring this 
interruption. “But I don’t care about that now — ” 

Page | 434 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What d’you mean, you don’t care? Don’t you want to 
learn to Apparate?” said Ron incredulously. 

“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said Harry, 
glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, 
and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall. 
“Look, hurry up, will you, there’s something I want to 
do. ...” 

Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor 
Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by 
Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor 
shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they 
set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply 
turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. 
Within five minutes, they were climbing through the 
portrait hole. 

“Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?” 
asked Ron, panting slightly. 

“Up here,” said Harry, and he crossed the common 
room and led the way through the door to the boys’ 
staircase. 

Their dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He 
flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, 
while Ron watched impatiently. 

“Harry ...” 

“Malfoy ’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was 
arguing with Crabbe just now. I want to know — 
aha.” 

He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank 
parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped 
with the tip of his wand. 



Page | 435 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy 
is anyway.” 

At once, the Marauder’s Map appeared on the 
parchment’s surface. Here was a detailed plan of 
every one of the castle’s floors and, moving around it, 
the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the 
castle’s occupants. 

“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently. 

He laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned 
over it, searching. 

“There!” said Ron, after a minute or so. “He’s in the 
Slytherin common room, look . . . with Parkinson and 
Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ...” 

Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but 
rallied almost at once. 

“Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now on,” he 
said firmly. “And the moment I see him lurking 
somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch 
outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and 
off to find out what he’s — ” 

He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing 
with him a strong smell of singed material, and began 
rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants. 

Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry 
had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. 
Although he consulted the map as often as he could, 
sometimes making unnecessary visits to the 
bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not 
once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he 
spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle 
on their own more often than usual, sometimes 
Page | 436 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at 
these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, 
but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was 
most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that 
Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but 
could not see how he could be doing it, given the very 
high level of security now operating within the castle. 
He could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy 
amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the 
map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle 
appeared to be going their different ways when they 
were usually inseparable, these things happened as 
people got older — Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected 
sadly, were living proof. 

February moved toward March with no change in the 
weather except that it became windy as well as wet. 

To general indignation, a sign went up on all common 
room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade 
had been canceled. Ron was furious. 

“It was on my birthday!” he said. “I was looking 
forward to that!” 

“Not a big surprise, though, is it?” said Harry. “Not 
after what happened to Katie.” 

She had still not returned from St. Mungo’s. What 
was more, further disappearances had been reported 
in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of 
students at Hogwarts. 

“But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid 
Apparition!” said Ron grumpily. “Big birthday treat ...” 

Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult 
as ever, though a few more people had managed to 
Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high 
and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling toward 

Page | 437 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Wilkie Twycross and his three D’s, which had inspired 
a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which 
were Dogbreath and Dunghead. 

“Happy birthday, Ron,” said Harry, when they were 
woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean 
leaving noisily for breakfast. “Have a present.” 

He threw the package across onto Ron’s bed, where it 
joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, 
have been delivered by house-elves in the night. 

“Cheers,” said Ron drowsily and, as he ripped off the 
paper, Harry got out of bed, opened his own trunk, 
and began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map, 
which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the 
contents of his trunk before he found it hiding 
beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still 
keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. 

“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, 
tapping it quietly and murmuring, “ I solemnly swear 
that I am up to no good,” so that Neville, who was 
passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not 
hear. 

“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving 
the new pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves Harry had 
given him. 

“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he 
searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. 
“Hey ... I don’t think he’s in his bed. ...” 

Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping 
presents, every now and then letting out an 
exclamation of pleasure. 



Page | 438 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Seriously good haul this year!” he announced, 
holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols 
around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of 
hands. “See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I 
think I’ll come of age next year too. ...” 

“Cool,” muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance 
before peering more closely at the map. Where was 
Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table 
in the Great Hall, eating breakfast. ... He was 
nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study. ... 
He wasn’t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital 
wing. ... 

“Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of 
Chocolate Cauldrons. 

“No thanks,” said Harry, looking up. “Malfoy’s gone 
again!” 

“Can’t have done,” said Ron, stuffing a second 
Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get 
dressed. “Come on, if you don’t hurry up, you’ll have 
to Apparate on an empty stomach. ... Might make it 
easier, I suppose ...” Ron looked thoughtfully at the 
box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and 
helped himself to a third. 

Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 
“Mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been, and got 
dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an 
explanation for Malfoy’s periodic disappearances, but 
he simply could not think what it could be. The best 
way of finding out would be to tail him, but even with 
the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea: 
Harry had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, 
and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around 
school all day without his absence being remarked 
upon. 

Page | 439 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Ready?” he said to Ron. 

He was halfway to the dormitory door when he 
realized that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on 
his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window 
with a strangely unfocused look on his face. 

“Ron? Breakfast.” 

“I’m not hungry.” 

Harry stared at him. 

“I thought you just said — ?” 

“Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, 
“but I don’t want to eat.” 

Harry scrutinized him suspiciously. 

“You’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, 
haven’t you?” 

“It’s not that,” Ron sighed again. “You ... you wouldn’t 
understand.” 

“Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he 
turned to open the door. 

“Harry!” said Ron suddenly. 

“What?” 

“Harry, I can’t stand it!” 

“You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starting to 
feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and 
looked as though he was about to be sick. 



Page | 440 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I can’t stop thinking about her!” said Ron hoarsely. 

Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and 
was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might 
be, but if Ron started calling Lavender “Lav-Lav,” he 
would have to put his foot down. 

“Why does that stop you having breakfast?” Harry 
asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into 
the proceedings. 

“I don’t think she knows I exist,” said Ron with a 
desperate gesture. 

“She definitely knows you exist,” said Harry, 
bewildered. “She keeps snogging you, doesn’t she?” 

Ron blinked. “Who are you talking about?” 

“Who are you talking about?” said Harry, with an 
increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of 
the conversation. 

“Romilda Vane,” said Ron softly, and his whole face 
seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a 
ray of purest sunlight. 

They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, 
before Harry said, “This is a joke, right? You’re 
joking.” 

“I think ... Harry, I think I love her,” said Ron in a 
strangled voice. 

“Okay,” said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better 
look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, 
“okay... Say that again with a straight face.” 



Page | 441 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I love her,” repeated Ron breathlessly. “Have you 
seen her hair, it’s all black and shiny and silky ... and 
her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her — ” 

“This is really funny and everything,” said Harry 
impatiently, “but joke’s over, all right? Drop it.” 

He turned to leave; he had got two steps toward the 
door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. 
Staggering, he looked around. Ron’s fist was drawn 
right back; his face was contorted with rage; he was 
about to strike again. 

Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his 
pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without 
conscious thought: Levicorpus\ 

Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once 
more; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his robes 
hanging off him. 

“ What was that for?” Harry bellowed. 

“You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!” 
shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the 
face as all the blood rushed to his head. 

“This is insane!” said Harry. “What’s got into — ?” 

And then he saw the box lying open on Ron’s bed, 
and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding 
troll. 

“Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?” 

“They were a birthday present!” shouted Ron, 
revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. 

“I offered you one, didn’t I?” 



Page | 442 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you?” 



“They’d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!” 

“They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you 
understand? They were mine, I chucked them out of 
my trunk when I was looking for the map, they’re the 
Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before 
Christmas, and they’re all spiked with love potion!” 

But only one word of this seemed to have registered 
with Ron. 

“Romilda?” he repeated. “Did you say Romilda? Harry 
— do you know her? Can you introduce me?” 

Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now 
looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong 
desire to laugh. A part of him — the part closest to 
his throbbing right ear — was quite keen on the idea 
of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until 
the effects of the potion wore off. . . . But on the other 
hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not 
been himself when he had attacked, and Harry 
thought that he would deserve another punching if he 
permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda 
Vane. 

“Yeah, I’ll introduce you,” said Harry, thinking fast. 
“I’m going to let you down now, okay?” 

He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did 
hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet 
again, grinning. 

“She’ll be in Slughorn’s office,” said Harry confidently, 
leading the way to the door. 



Page | 443 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Why will she be in there?” asked Ron anxiously, 
hurrying to keep up. 

“Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,” said 
Harry, inventing wildly. 

“Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?” said 
Ron eagerly. 

“Great idea,” said Harry. 

Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a 
complication Harry had not foreseen. 

“You’re late, Won-Won!” she pouted. “I’ve got you a 
birthday — ” 

“Leave me alone,” said Ron impatiently. “Harry’s going 
to introduce me to Romilda Vane.” 

And without another word to her, he pushed his way 
out of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an 
apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned 
out simply amused, because she looked more 
offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut 
behind them. 

Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might 
be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the 
first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing gown and 
matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed. 

“Harry,” he mumbled. “This is very early for a call. ... I 
generally sleep late on a Saturday. ...” 

“Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you,” said Harry 
as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, 
attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, “but 
my friend Ron’s swallowed a love potion by mistake. 

Page | 444 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




You couldn’t make him an antidote, could you? I’d 
take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we’re not supposed 
to have anything from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and, 
you know ... awkward questions ...” 

“I’d have thought you could have whipped him up a 
remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?” asked 
Slughorn. 

“Er,” said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that 
Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt 
to force his way into the room, “well, I’ve never mixed 
an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get 
it right, Ron might’ve done something serious — ” 

Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, “I can’t 
see her, Harry — is he hiding her?” 

“Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now 
eyeing Ron with professional interest. “They can 
strengthen, you know, the longer they’re kept.” 

“That would explain a lot,” panted Harry, now 
positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from 
knocking Slughorn over. “It’s his birthday, Professor,” 
he added imploringly. 

“Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,” said Slughorn, 
relenting. “I’ve got the necessary here in my bag, it’s 
not a difficult antidote. ...” 

Ron burst through the door into Slughorn ’s 
overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasseled 
footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry 
around the neck, and muttered, “She didn’t see that, 
did she?” 



Page | 445 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“She’s not here yet,” said Harry, watching Slughorn 
opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of 
this and that to a small crystal bottle. 

“That’s good,” said Ron fervently. “How do I look?” 

“Very handsome,” said Slughorn smoothly, handing 
Ron a glass of clear liquid. “Now drink that up, it’s a 
tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, 
you know.” 

“Brilliant,” said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the 
antidote down noisily. 

Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron 
beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged 
and vanished, to be replaced by an expression of 
utmost horror. 

“Back to normal, then?” said Harry, grinning. 
Slughorn chuckled. “Thanks a lot, Professor.” 

“Don’t mention it, m’boy, don’t mention it,” said 
Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, 
looking devastated. “Pick-me-up, that’s what he 
needs,” Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a 
table loaded with drinks. “I’ve got butterbeer, I’ve got 
wine, I’ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead 
. . . hmm . . . meant to give that to Dumbledore for 
Christmas ... ah, well ...” He shrugged. “He can’t miss 
what he’s never had! Why don’t we open it now and 
celebrate Mr. Weasley’s birthday? Nothing like a fine 
spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. 



He chortled again, and Harry joined in. This was the 
first time he had found himself almost alone with 
Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract 
the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just 

Page | 446 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




keep Slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they got 
through enough of the oak-matured mead . . . 

“There you are then,” said Slughorn, handing Harry 
and Ron a glass of mead each before raising his own. 
“Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph — ” 

“Ron — ” whispered Harry. 

But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the 
toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth 
and swallowed it. 

There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, 
in which Harry knew there was something terribly 
wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not. 

“ — and may you have many more — ” 

“Ron\” 

Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his 
chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking 
uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth, 
and his eyes were bulging from their sockets. 

“Professor!” Harry bellowed. “Do something!” 

But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. Ron 
twitched and choked: His skin was turning blue. 

“What — but — ” spluttered Slughorn. 

Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward 
Slughorn ’s open potion kit, pulling out jars and 
pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron’s gargling 
breath filled the room. Then he found it — the 
shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from 
him in Potions. 

Page | 447 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He hurtled back to Ron’s side, wrenched open his 
jaw, and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a 
great shudder, a rattling gasp, and his body became 
limp and still. 



Page | 448 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 








ELF TAILS 

“So, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays?” said 
Fred. 

It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the 
windows curtained, the lamps lit. Ron’s was the only 
occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were 
sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting 
outside the double doors, trying to see inside 
whenever somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey 
had only let them enter at eight o’clock. Fred and 
George had arrived at ten past. 

“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our 
present,” said George grimly, putting down a large 
wrapped gift on Ron’s bedside cabinet and sitting 
beside Ginny. 

“Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was 
conscious,” said Fred. 

“There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise 
him — ” said George. 

Page | 449 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“You were in Hogsmeade?” asked Ginny, looking up. 

“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred 
gloomily. “A Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat 
lot of good it’ll do us if you lot aren’t allowed out at 
weekends to buy our stuff anymore. ... But never 
mind that now.” 

He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron’s 
pale face. 

“How exactly did it happen, Harry?” 

Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt 
like a hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, 
to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny. 

"... and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his 
breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, 
McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they 
brought Ron up here. They reckon he’ll be all right. 
Madam Pomfrey says hell have to stay here a week or 
so ... keep taking essence of rue ...” 

“Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,” said 
George in a low voice. 

“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Harry, who 
kept turning cold at the thought of what would have 
happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the 
little stone. 

Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had 
been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, 
white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing 
and demanded to know what had happened, she had 
taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny’s obsessive 
discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but 
merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and 
Page | 450 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




frightened-looking, until at last they had been allowed 
in to see him. 

“Do Mum and Dad know?” Fred asked Ginny. 

“They’ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago 
— they’re in Dumbledore’s office now, but they’ll be 
back soon. ...” 

There was a pause while they all watched Ron 
mumble a little in his sleep. 

“So the poison was in the drink?” said Fred quietly. 

“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing 
else and was glad for the opportunity to start 
discussing it again. “Slughorn poured it out — ” 

“Would he have been able to slip something into Ron’s 
glass without you seeing?” 

“Probably,” said Harry, “but why would Slughorn 
want to poison Ron?” 

“No idea,” said Fred, frowning. “You don’t think he 
could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning 
to get you?” 

“Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?” asked 
Ginny. 

“I dunno,” said Fred, “but there must be loads of 
people who’d like to poison Harry, mustn’t there? The 
Chosen One’ and all that?” 

“So you think Slughorn ’s a Death Eater?” said Ginny. 
“Anything’s possible,” said Fred darkly. 



Page | 451 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He could be under the Imperius Curse,” said George. 

“Or he could be innocent,” said Ginny. “The poison 
could have been in the bottle, in which case it was 
probably meant for Slughorn himself.” 

“Who’d want to kill Slughorn?” 

“Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on 
his side,” said Harry. “Slughorn was in hiding for a 
year before he came to Hogwarts. And ...” He thought 
of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to 
extract from Slughorn. “And maybe Voldemort wants 
him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be 
valuable to Dumbledore.” 

“But you said Slughorn had been planning to give 
that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas,” Ginny 
reminded him. “So the poisoner could just as easily 
have been after Dumbledore.” 

“Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,” 
said Hermione, speaking for the first time in hours 
and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. 
“Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there 
was a good chance he’d keep something that tasty for 
himself.” 

“Er-my-nee,” croaked Ron unexpectedly from between 
them. 

They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after 
muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely 
started snoring. 

The dormitory doors flew open, making them all 
jump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his hair 
rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a 



Page | 452 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy 
dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor. 

“Bin in the forest all day!” he panted. “Aragog’s worse, 
I bin readin’ to him — didn’ get up ter dinner till jus’ 
now an’ then Professor Sprout told me abou’ Ron! 

How is he?” 

“Not bad,” said Harry. “They say he’ll be okay.” 

“No more than six visitors at a time!” said Madam 
Pomfrey, hurrying out of her office. 

“Hagrid makes six,” George pointed out. 

“Oh ... yes ...” said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to 
have been counting Hagrid as several people due to 
his vastness. To cover her confusion, she hurried off 
to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand. 

“I don’ believe this,” said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his 
great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron. “Jus’ 
don’ believe it ... Look at him lyin’ there. ... Who’d 
want ter hurt him, eh?” 

“That’s just what we were discussing,” said Harry. 

“We don’t know.” 

“Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the 
Gryffindor Quidditch team, could they?” said Hagrid 
anxiously. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron ...” 

“I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch 
team,” said George. 

“Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got 
away with it,” said Fred fairly. 



Page | 453 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a 
connection between the attacks,” said Hermione 
quietly. 

“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred. 

“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been 
fatal and weren’t, although that was pure luck. And 
for another, neither the poison nor the necklace 
seems to have reached the person who was supposed 
to be killed. Of course,” she added broodingly, “that 
makes the person behind this even more dangerous 
in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many 
people they finish off before they actually reach their 
victim.” 

Before anybody could respond to this ominous 
pronouncement, the dormitory doors opened again 
and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward. They 
had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron 
would make a full recovery on their last visit to the 
ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and 
hugged him very tightly. “Dumbledore’s told us how 
you saved him with the bezoar,” she sobbed. “Oh, 
Harry, what can we say? You saved Ginny ... you 
saved Arthur ... now you’ve saved Ron ...” 

“Don’t be ... I didn’t ...” muttered Harry awkwardly. 

“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now 
I stop and think about it,” Mr. Weasley said in a 
constricted voice. “Well, all I can say is that it was a 
lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in 
your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.” 

Harry could not think of any reply to this and was 
almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them 
that there were only supposed to be six visitors 
around Ron’s bed; he and Hermione rose at once to 

Page | 454 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




leave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron 
with his family. 

“It’s terrible,” growled Hagrid into his beard, as the 
three of them walked back along the corridor to the 
marble staircase. “All this new security, an’ kids are 
still gettin’ hurt. ... Dumbledore’s worried sick. ... He 
don’ say much, but I can tell. ...” 

“Hasn’t he got any ideas, Hagrid?” asked Hermione 
desperately. 

“I ’spect he’s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,” 
said Hagrid. “But he doesn’ know who sent that 
necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they’d ’ve bin 
caught, wouldn’ they? Wha’ worries me,” said Hagrid, 
lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder 
(Harry, for good measure, checked the ceiling for 
Peeves), “is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids 
are bein’ attacked. Chamber o’ Secrets all over again, 
isn’ it? There’ll be panic, more parents takin’ their 
kids outta school, an’ nex’ thing yeh know the board 
o’ governors ...” 

Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired 
woman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a 
hoarse whisper, "... the board o’ governors’ll be talkin’ 
about shuttin’ us up fer good.” 

“Surely not?” said Hermione, looking worried. 

“Gotta see it from their point o’ view,” said Hagrid 
heavily. “I mean, it’s always bin a bit of a risk sendin’ 
a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it? Yer expect accidents, 
don’ yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all 
locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha’s 
diff’rent. ’S’no wonder Dumbledore’s angry with Sn — 



Page | 455 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty 
expression on what was visible of his face above his 
tangled black beard. 

“What?” said Harry quickly. “Dumbledore’s angry with 
Snape?” 

“I never said tha’,” said Hagrid, though his look of 
panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. “Look at 
the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter — ” 

“Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?” 

Harry asked loudly. 

“Shhhh!” said Hagrid, looking both nervous and 
angry. “Don’ shout stuff like that, Harry, d’yeh wan’ 
me ter lose me job? Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d care, 
would yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag — ” 

“Don’t try and make me feel guilty, it won’t work!” 
said Harry forcefully. “What’s Snape done?” 

“I dunno, Harry, I shouldn’ta heard it at all! I — well, I 
was cornin’ outta the forest the other evenin’ an’ I 
overheard ’em talking — well, arguin’. Didn’t like ter 
draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an’ tried 
not ter listen, but it was a — well, a heated discussion 
an’ it wasn’ easy ter block it out.” 

“Well?” Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his 
enormous feet uneasily. 

“Well — I jus’ heard Snape sayin’ Dumbledore took 
too much fer granted an’ maybe he — Snape — didn’ 
wan’ ter do it anymore — ” 

“Do what?” 



Page | 456 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin’ a 
bit overworked, tha’s all — anyway, Dumbledore told 
him flat out he’d agreed ter do it an’ that was all there 
was to it. Pretty firm with him. An’ then he said 
summat abou’ Snape makin’ investigations in his 
House, in Slytherin. Well, there’s nothin’ strange 
abou’ that!” Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and 
Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. “All the 
Heads o’ Houses were asked ter look inter that 
necklace business — ” 

“Yeah, but Dumbledore ’s not having rows with the 
rest of them, is he?” said Harry. 

“Look,” Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in 
his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it 
snapped in two. “I know what yeh’re like abou’ Snape, 
Harry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter 
this than there is.” 

“Look out,” said Hermione tersely. 

They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus 
Filch looming over the wall behind them before the 
man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his 
jowls aquiver. 

“Oho!” he wheezed. “Out of bed so late, this’ll mean 
detention!” 

“No it won’, Filch,” said Hagrid shortly. “They’re with 
me, aren’ they?” 

“And what difference does that make?” asked Filch 
obnoxiously. 

“I’m a ruddy teacher, aren’ I, yeh sneakin’ Squib!” 
said Hagrid, firing up at once. 



Page | 457 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with 
fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was 
twisting herself sinuously around Filch’s skinny 
ankles. 

“Get goin’,” said Hagrid out of the corner of his 
mouth. 

Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione 
both hurried off; Hagrid’s and Filch’s raised voices 
echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves 
near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was 
streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, 
cackling and calling, 

When there’s strife and when there’s trouble 
Call on Peevsie, he’ll make double! 

The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be 
woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to 
clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty 
common room. It did not seem that people knew 
about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been 
interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him 
good night and set off for the girls’ dormitory. Harry, 
however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the 
fire and looking down into the dying embers. 

So Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all 
he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he 
trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with 
him. ... He did not think that Snape had tried hard 
enough to investigate the Slytherins ... or, perhaps, to 
investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy? 

Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do 
anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, 
that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry’s 
suspicions? That seemed likely. It might even be that 

Page | 458 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry 
from their lessons, or from procuring that memory 
from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it 
right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen- 
year-olds. ... 

“There you are, Potter!” 

Harry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the 
ready. He had been quite convinced that the common 
room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for 
a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant 
chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac 
McLaggen. 

“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said 
McLaggen, disregarding Harry’s drawn wand. 

“Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking 
Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look 
like he’ll be fit for next week’s match.” 

It took Harry a few moments to realize what 
McLaggen was talking about. 

“Oh ... right ... Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand 
back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand 
wearily through his hair. “Yeah ... he might not make 
it.” 

“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said 
McLaggen. 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so. ...” 

He could not think of an argument against it; after 
all, McLaggen had certainly performed second-best in 
the trials. 



Page | 459 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Excellent,” said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. “So 
when’s practice?” 

“What? Oh ... there’s one tomorrow evening.” 

“Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk 
beforehand. I’ve got some ideas on strategy you might 
find useful.” 

“Right,” said Harry unenthusiastically. “Well, I’ll hear 
them tomorrow, then. I’m pretty tired now ... see you 



The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly 
next day, but it did not cause the sensation that 
Katie’s attack had done. People seemed to think that 
it might have been an accident, given that he had 
been in the Potions master’s room at the time, and 
that as he had been given an antidote immediately 
there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors 
were generally much more interested in the upcoming 
Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them 
wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on 
the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his 
commentary during the opening match against 
Slytherin. 

Harry, however, had never been less interested in 
Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with 
Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder’s Map 
whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made 
detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had 
not yet detected him doing anything out of the 
ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times 
when Malfoy simply vanished from the map. ... 

But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the 
problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, 



Page | 460 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever 
he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. 

He could not decide which of them was more 
annoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of 
hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper 
for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was 
seeing him play regularly he would surely come 
around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen 
to criticize the other players and provide Harry with 
detailed training schemes, so that more than once 
Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain. 

Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to 
discuss Ron, which Harry found almost more wearing 
than McLaggen’s Quidditch lectures. At first, 

Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had 
thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing 
— “I mean, I am his girlfriend!” — but unfortunately 
she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of 
memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats 
with him about Ron’s feelings, a most uncomfortable 
experience that Harry would have happily forgone. 

“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” 

Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation 
from Lavender that took in everything from precisely 
what Ron had said about her new dress robes to 
whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his 
relationship with Lavender to be “serious.” 

“Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and 
see him!” said Lavender fretfully. 

“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron 
perfectly alert every time he had been up to the 
hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of 
Dumbledore and Snape’s row and keen to abuse 
McLaggen as much as possible. 

Page | 461 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender 
demanded suddenly. 

“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” 
said Harry uncomfortably. 

“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Lavender 
scornfully. “She didn’t talk to him for weeks after he 
started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to 
make up with him now he’s all interesting. ...” 

“Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” 
asked Harry. “Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s 
McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,” said 
Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a 
door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down 
the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where, 
thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could 
follow him. 

On the morning of the Quidditch match against 
Hufflepuff, Harry dropped in on the hospital wing 
before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very 
agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down 
to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him. 

“So how’s McLaggen shaping up?” he asked Harry 
nervously, apparently forgetting that he had already 
asked the same question twice. 

“I’ve told you,” said Harry patiently, “he could be 
world-class and I wouldn’t want to keep him. He 
keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he 
could play every position better than the rest of us. I 
can’t wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting 
shot of people,” Harry added, getting to his feet and 
picking up his Firebolt, “will you stop pretending to 
be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She’s 
driving me mad as well.”

“Oh,” said Ron, looking sheepish. “Yeah. All right.” 

“If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell 
her,” said Harry. 

“Yeah ... well ... it’s not that easy, is it?” said Ron. He 
paused. “Hermione going to look in before the 
match?” he added casually. 

“No, she’s already gone down to the pitch with 
Ginny.” 

“Oh,” said Ron, looking rather glum. “Right. Well, 
good luck. Hope you hammer McLag — I mean, 
Smith.” 

“I’ll try,” said Harry, shouldering his broom. “See you 
after the match.” 

He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the 
whole school was outside, either already seated in the 
stadium or heading down toward it. He was looking 
out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how 
much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead 
made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking 
toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom 
looked sulky and resentful. 

Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave 
a short, humorless laugh and continued walking. 

“Where ’re you going?” Harry demanded. 

“Yeah, I’m really going to tell you, because it’s your 
business, Potter,” sneered Malfoy. “You’d better hurry 
up, they’ll be waiting for ‘the Chosen Captain’ — ‘the 
Boy Who Scored’ — whatever they call you these 
days.” 



Page | 463 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared 
at her. She blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and 
she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the 
corner and vanishing from view. 

Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them 
disappear. This was infuriating; he was already 
cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet 
there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the 
school was absent: Harry’s best chance yet of 
discovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent seconds 
trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, 
frozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy had 
vanished. ... 

“Where have you been?” demanded Ginny, as Harry 
sprinted into the changing rooms. The whole team 
was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the 
Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously 
against their legs. 

“I met Malfoy,” Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his 
scarlet robes over his head. 

“So?” 

“So I wanted to know how come he’s up at the castle 
with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is 
down here. ...” 

“Does it matter right now?” 

“Well, I’m not likely to find out, am I?” said Harry, 
seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. 
“Come on then!” 

And without another word, he marched out onto the 
pitch to deafening cheers and boos. 



Page | 464 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every 
now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright 
sunlight. 

“Tricky conditions!” McLaggen said bracingly to the 
team. “Coote, Peakes, you’ll want to fly out of the sun, 
so they don’t see you coming — ” 

“I’m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them 
instructions,” said Harry angrily. “Just get up by the 
goal posts!” 

Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to 
Coote and Peakes. 

“Make sure you do fly out of the sun,” he told them 
grudgingly. 

He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and 
then, on Madam Hooch’s whistle, kicked off and rose 
into the air, higher than the rest of his team, 
streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If 
he could catch it good and early, there might be a 
chance he could get back up to the castle, seize the 
Marauder’s Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing. 



“And that’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,” said 
a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. “He did the 
commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley 
flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked 
like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I 
expect he regrets that now he’s playing them — oh, 
look, he’s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I 
do like her, she’s very nice. ...” 

Harry stared down at the commentator’s podium. 
Surely nobody in their right mind would have let 
Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from above 

Page | 465 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, 
nor the necklace of butterbeer corks. ... Beside Luna, 
Professor McGonagall was looking slightly 
uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having 
second thoughts about this appointment. 

"... but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the 
Quaffle from her, I can’t remember his name, it’s 
something like Bibble — no, Buggins — ” 

“It’s Cadwallader!” said Professor McGonagall loudly 
from beside Luna. The crowd laughed. 

Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign 
of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen 
had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the 
Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he 
had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his 
right ear. 

“McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re 
supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!” 
bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper. 

“You’re not setting a great example!” McLaggen 
shouted back, red-faced and furious. 

“And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his 
Keeper,” said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs 
and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. 
“I don’t think that’ll help him find the Snitch, but 
maybe it’s a clever ruse. ...” 

Swearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off 
around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some 
sign of the tiny, winged golden ball. 

Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the 
red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to 

Page | 466 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making 
things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; 
she appeared singularly uninterested in such 
mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to 
draw the crowd’s attention to such things as 
interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that 
Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain 
possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, 
was suffering from something called “Loser’s Lurgy.” 

“Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!” barked Professor 
McGonagall into Luna’s megaphone. 

“Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely. “Oh, look! The 
Gryffindor Keeper’s got hold of one of the Beater’s 
bats.” 

Harry spun around in midair. Sure enough, 

McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had 
pulled Peakes ’s bat from him and appeared to be 
demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an 
oncoming Cadwallader. 

“ Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal 
posts!” roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as 
McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and 
mishit it. 

A blinding, sickening pain ... a flash of light . . . distant 
screams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long 
tunnel ... 

And the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a 
remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking 
up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light 
onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head 
awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, 
freckly, red-haired person. 



Page | 467 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Nice of you to drop in,” said Ron, grinning. 

Harry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was 
in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo 
streaked with crimson. The match must have finished 
hours ago ... as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. 
Harry’s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand 
and felt a stiff turban of bandages. 

“What happened?” 

“Cracked skull,” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up 
and pushing him back against his pillows. “Nothing to 
worry about, I mended it at once, but I’m keeping you 
in overnight. You shouldn’t overexert yourself for a 
few hours.” 

“I don’t want to stay here overnight,” said Harry 
angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. “I 
want to find McLaggen and kill him.” 

“I’m afraid that would come under the heading of 
‘overexertion,’ ” said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him 
firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a 
threatening manner. “You will stay here until I 
discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.” 

She bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back 
into his pillows, fuming. 

“D’you know how much we lost by?” he asked Ron 
through clenched teeth. 

“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apologetically. “Final score 
was three hundred and twenty to sixty.” 

“Brilliant,” said Harry savagely. “Really brilliant! 

When I get hold of McLaggen — ” 



Page | 468 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a 
troll,” said Ron reasonably. “Personally, I think there’s 
a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing 
of the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest of the team might’ve 
dealt with him before you get out of here, they’re not 
happy. ...” 

There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron’s 
voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled 
that McLaggen had messed up so badly. Harry lay 
there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, 
his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but 
feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging. 

“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said 
Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. “I hope 
Luna always commentates from now on. ... Loser’s 
Lurgy ...” 

But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in 
the situation, and after a while Ron’s snorts subsided. 

“Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” 
he said, after a long pause, and Harry’s imagination 
zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in 
which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed 
her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave 
them his blessing. ... “She reckons you only just 
arrived on time for the match. How come? You left 
here early enough.” 

“Oh ...” said Harry, as the scene in his mind’s eye 
imploded. “Yeah ... well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off 
with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted 
to be with him, and that’s the second time he’s made 
sure he isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the 
rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, 
remember?” Harry sighed. “Wish I’d followed him 
now, the match was such a fiasco. ...” 

Page | 469 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron sharply. “You couldn’t 
have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, 
you’re the Captain!” 

“I want to know what he’s up to,” said Harry. “And 
don’t tell me it’s all in my head, not after what I 
overheard between him and Snape — ” 

“I never said it was all in your head,” said Ron, 
hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning 
at Harry, “but there’s no rule saying only one person 
at a time can be plotting anything in this place! You’re 
getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, 
thinking about missing a match just to follow him ...” 

“I want to catch him at it!” said Harry in frustration. 

“I mean, where’s he going when he disappears off the 
map?” 

“I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?” suggested Ron, yawning. 

“I’ve never seen him going along any of the secret 
passageways on the map. I thought they were being 
watched now anyway?” 

“Well then, I dunno,” said Ron. 

Silence fell between them. Harry stared up at the 
circle of lamplight above him, thinking. . . . 

If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would 
have been able to set a tail upon Malfoy, but 
unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of 
Aurors at his command. ... He thought fleetingly of 
trying to set something up with the D.A., but there 
again was the problem that people would be missed 
from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full 
schedules. ... 



Page | 470 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There was a low, rumbling snore from Ron’s bed. 

After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, 
this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It was 
easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto his side 
and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as 
she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she 
returned to her office; he heard the door click behind 
her and knew that she was off to bed. 

This was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third 
time that he had been brought to the hospital wing 
because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen 
off his broom due to the presence of dementors 
around the pitch, and the time before that, all the 
bones had been removed from his arm by the 
incurably inept Professor Lockhart. ... That had been 
his most painful injury by far ... he remembered the 
agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a 
discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected 
visitor in the middle of the — 

Harry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his 
bandage turban askew. He had the solution at last: 
There was a way to have Malfoy followed — how could 
he have forgotten, why hadn’t he thought of it before? 

But the question was, how to call him? What did you 
do? 

Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness. 
“Kreacher?” 

There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of 
scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron 
awoke with a yelp. 

“What’s going — ?” 



Page | 471 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam 
Pomfrey’s office and muttered, “MuffliatoV’ so that she 
would not come running. Then he scrambled to the 
end of his bed for a better look at what was going on. 

Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in 
the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken 
maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a 
filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. 
Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the 
Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling 
elves. 

“I was watching that, Potty!” he told Harry 
indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting 
out a loud cackle. “Look at the ickle creatures 
squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy — ” 

“Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of 
Dobby, no he won’t, or Dobby will shut Kreacher’s 
mouth for him!” cried Dobby in a high-pitched voice. 

“ — kicky, scratchy!” cried Peeves happily, now pelting 
bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further. 
“Tweaky, pokey!” 

“Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh 
yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of 
Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher’s mistress 
say — ?” 

Exactly what Kreacher’s mistress would have said 
they did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank 
his knobbly little fist into Kreacher’s mouth and 
knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both 
leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves 
apart, though they continued to try and kick and 
punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped 



Page | 472 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




around the lamp squealing, “Stick your fingers up his 
nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies — ” 

Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlockl” 
Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped 
from the room making obscene gestures but unable to 
speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just 
glued itself to the roof of his mouth. 

“Nice one,” said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into 
the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made 
contact with Kreacher. “That was another Prince hex, 
wasn’t it?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, twisting Kreacher’s wizened arm 
into a half nelson. “Right — I’m forbidding you to fight 
each other! Well, Kreacher, you’re forbidden to fight 
Dobby. Dobby, I know I’m not allowed to give you 
orders — ” 

“Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he 
likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants 
him to do!” said Dobby, tears now streaming down his 
shriveled little face onto his jumper. 

“Okay then,” said Harry, and he and Ron both 
released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not 
continue fighting. 

“Master called me?” croaked Kreacher, sinking into a 
bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished 
him a painful death. 

“Yeah, I did,” said Harry, glancing toward Madam 
Pomfrey’s office door to check that the Muffliato spell 
was still working; there was no sign that she had 
heard any of the commotion. “I’ve got a job for you.” 



Page | 473 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Kreacher will do whatever Master wants,” said 
Kreacher, sinking so low that his lips almost touched 
his gnarled toes, “because Kreacher has no choice, 
but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes 



“Dobby will do it, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, his 
tennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming in tears. “Dobby 
would be honored to help Harry Potter!” 

“Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of 
you,” said Harry. “Okay then ... I want you to tail 
Draco Malfoy.” 

Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and 
exasperation on Ron’s face, Harry went on, “I want to 
know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what 
he’s doing. I want you to follow him around the 
clock.” 

“Yes, Harry Potter!” said Dobby at once, his great eyes 
shining with excitement. “And if Dobby does it wrong, 
Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry 
Potter!” 

“There won’t be any need for that,” said Harry hastily. 

“Master wants me to follow the youngest of the 
Malfoys?” croaked Kreacher. “Master wants me to spy 
upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old 
mistress?” 

“That’s the one,” said Harry, foreseeing a great danger 
and determining to prevent it immediately. “And 
you’re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show 
him what you’re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to 
write him messages or ... or to contact him in any 
way. Got it?” 



Page | 474 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a 
loophole in the instructions he had just been given 
and waited. After a moment or two, and to Harry’s 
great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and 
said, with bitter resentment, “Master thinks of 
everything, and Kreacher must obey him even though 
Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the 
Malfoy boy, oh yes. ...” 

“That’s settled, then,” said Harry. “I’ll want regular 
reports, but make sure I’m not surrounded by people 
when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And 
don’t tell anyone what you’re doing. Just stick to 
Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters.”

LORD VOLDEMORT’S REQUEST 

Harry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on 
Monday morning, restored to full health by the 
ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to 
enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and 
poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was 
friends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted them 
down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that 
Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature 
in Harry’s chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the 
air hopefully. 

“What did they row about?” he asked, trying to sound 
casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor 
that was deserted but for a very small girl who had 
been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She 
looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth 
years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was 
carrying. 

“It’s all right!” said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward 
to help her. “Here ...” 



Page | 476 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



She tapped the broken scales with her wand and 
said, “Reparo.” The girl did not say thank you, but 
remained rooted to the spot as they passed and 
watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her. 

“I swear they’re getting smaller,” he said. 

“Never mind her,” said Harry, a little impatiently. 
“What did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?” 

“Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that 
Bludger at you,” said Hermione. 

“It must’ve looked funny,” said Ron reasonably. 

“It didn’t look funny at all!” said Hermione hotly. “It 
looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn’t caught 
Harry he could have been very badly hurt!” 

“Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to 
split up over it,” said Harry, still trying to sound 
casual. “Or are they still together?” 

“Yes, they are — but why are you so interested?” 
asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look. 

“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up 
again!” he said hastily, but Hermione continued to 
look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a 
voice behind them called, “Harry!” giving him an 
excuse to turn his back on her. 

“Oh, hi, Luna.” 

“I went to the hospital wing to find you,” said Luna, 
rummaging in her bag. “But they said you’d left. ...” 

She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large 
spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what 

Page | 477 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




looked like cat litter into Ron’s hands, finally pulling 
out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she 
handed to Harry. 

"... I’ve been told to give you this.” 

It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry 
recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson 
with Dumbledore. 

“Tonight,” he told Ron and Hermione, once he had 
unrolled it. 

“Nice commentary last match!” said Ron to Luna as 
she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the 
cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely. 

“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” she said. 
“Everyone says I was dreadful.” 

“No, I’m serious!” said Ron earnestly. “I can’t 
remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, 
by the way?” he added, holding the onionlike object 
up to eye level. 

“Oh, it’s a Gurdyroot,” she said, stuffing the cat litter 
and the toadstool back into her bag. “You can keep it 
if you like, I’ve got a few of them. They’re really 
excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.” 

And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still 
clutching the Gurdyroot. 

“You know, she’s grown on me, Luna,” he said, as 
they set off again for the Great Hall. “I know she’s 
insane, but it’s in a good — ” 



Page | 478 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown 
was standing at the foot of the marble staircase 
looking thunderous. 

“Hi,” said Ron nervously. 

“C’mon,” Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped 
past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, 
“Why didn’t you tell me you were getting out today? 
And why was she with you?” 

Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he 
appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though 
he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them 
exchange a word all the time they were together. 
Hermione was acting as though she was quite 
oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an 
inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she 
seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that 
evening in the common room she even consented to 
look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry’s 
Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely 
refusing to do up to this point, because she had 
known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. 

“Thanks a lot, Hermione,” said Harry, giving her a 
hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and 
saw that it was nearly eight o’clock. “Listen, I’ve got to 
hurry or I’ll be late for Dumbledore. ...” 

She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of 
his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, 
Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to 
the headmaster’s office. The gargoyle leapt aside at 
the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral 
staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door 
just as a clock within chimed eight. 



Page | 479 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Enter,” called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a 
hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from 
inside. There stood Professor Trelawney. 

“Aha!” she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as 
she blinked at him through her magnifying 
spectacles. “So this is the reason I am to be thrown 
unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!” 

“My dear Sybill,” said Dumbledore in a slightly 
exasperated voice, “there is no question of throwing 
you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does 
have an appointment, and I really don’t think there is 
any more to be said — ” 

“Very well,” said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply 
wounded voice. “If you will not banish the usurping 
nag, so be it. ... Perhaps I shall find a school where 
my talents are better appreciated. ...” 

She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the 
spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway 
down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over 
one of her trailing shawls. 

“Please close the door and sit down, Harry,” said 
Dumbledore, sounding rather tired. 

Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in 
front of Dumbledore ’s desk that the Pensieve lay 
between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal 
bottles full of swirling memory. 

“Professor Trelawney still isn’t happy Firenze is 
teaching, then?” Harry asked. 

“No,” said Dumbledore, “Divination is turning out to 
be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, 
never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask 

Page | 480 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an 
outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. 
Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she 
would be in outside the castle. She does not know — 
and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her — 
that she made the prophecy about you and 
Voldemort, you see.” 

Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, “But 
never mind my staffing problems. We have much 
more important matters to discuss. Firstly — have 
you managed the task I set you at the end of our 
previous lesson?” 

“Ah,” said Harry, brought up short. What with 
Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being 
poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his 
determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up 
to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory 
Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor 
Slughorn. “Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it 
at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it 
to me.” 

There was a little silence. 

“I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry 
over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving 
Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. 
“And you feel that you have exerted your very best 
efforts in this matter, do you? That you have 
exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you 
have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your 
quest to retrieve the memory?” 

“Well,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. 

His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly 
seemed embarrassingly feeble. “Well ... the day Ron 
swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to 

Page | 481 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor 
Slughorn in a good enough mood — ” 

“And did that work?” asked Dumbledore. 

“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned — ” 

“ — which, naturally, made you forget all about trying 
to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing 
else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it 
became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a 
full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you 
returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it 
clear to you how very important that memory is. 
Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is 
the most crucial memory of all and that we will be 
wasting our time without it.” 

A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of 
Harry’s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore 
had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, 
but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold 
disappointment was worse than anything. 

“Sir,” he said, a little desperately, “it isn’t that I wasn’t 
bothered or anything, I’ve just had other — other 
things ...” 

“Other things on your mind,” Dumbledore finished 
the sentence for him. “I see.” 

Silence fell between them again, the most 
uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced 
with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, 
punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the 
portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore ’s head. 
Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had 
shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When 
he could stand it no longer he said, “Professor 
Page | 482 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore, I’m really sorry. I should have done 
more. ... I should have realized you wouldn’t have 
asked me to do it if it wasn’t really important.” 

“Thank you for saying that, Harry,” said Dumbledore 
quietly. “May I hope, then, that you will give this 
matter higher priority from now on? There will be 
little point in our meeting after tonight unless we 
have that memory.” 

“I’ll do it, sir, I’ll get it from him,” he said earnestly. 

“Then we shall say no more about it just now,” said 
Dumbledore more kindly, “but continue with our 
story where we left off. You remember where that 
was?” 

“Yes, sir,” said Harry quickly. “Voldemort killed his 
father and his grandparents and made it look as 
though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to 
Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor 
Slughorn about Horcruxes,” he mumbled 
shamefacedly. 

“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Now, you will 
remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of 
these meetings of ours that we would be entering the 
realms of guesswork and speculation?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you 
reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as 
to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?” 

Harry nodded. 

“But now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “now things 
become murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find 

Page | 483 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost 
impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce 
about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether 
there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could 
give us a full account of his life since he left 
Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I 
would like to share with you.” Dumbledore indicated 
the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the 
Pensieve. “I shall then be glad of your opinion as to 
whether the conclusions I have drawn from them 
seem likely.” 

The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this 
highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed 
that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux 
memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as 
Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the 
light and examined it. 

“I hope you are not tired of diving into other people’s 
memories, for they are curious recollections, these 
two,” he said. “This first one came from a very old 
house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what 
Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord 
Voldemort left Hogwarts. 

“He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as 
you might have expected, top grades in every 
examination he had taken. All around him, his 
classmates were deciding which jobs they were to 
pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody 
expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, 
Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to 
the School. I know that several teachers, Professor 
Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the 
Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put 
him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all 
offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was 
working at Borgin and Burkes.” 

Page | 484 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“At Borgin and Burkes?” Harry repeated, stunned. 



“At Borgin and Burkes,” repeated Dumbledore calmly. 
“I think you will see what attractions the place held 
for him when we have entered Hokey’s memory. But 
this was not Voldemort’s first choice of job. Hardly 
anyone knew of it at the time — I was one of the few 
in whom the then headmaster confided — but 
Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and 
asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a 
teacher.” 

“He wanted to stay here? Why?” asked Harry, more 
amazed still. 

“I believe he had several reasons, though he confided 
none of them to Professor Dippet,” said Dumbledore. 
“Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I 
believe, more attached to this school than he has ever 
been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been 
happiest; the first and only place he had felt at 
home.” 

Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for 
this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too. 

“Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. 
Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of 
its secrets than most of the students who pass 
through the place, but he may have felt that there 
were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap. 

“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great 
power and influence over young witches and wizards. 
Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor 
Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best 
terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a 
teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that 
Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at 
Page | 485 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful 
recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin 
to build himself an army.” 

“But he didn’t get the job, sir?” 

“No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was 
too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a 
few years, if he still wished to teach.” 

“How did you feel about that, sir?” asked Harry 
hesitantly. 

“Deeply uneasy,” said Dumbledore. “I had advised 
Armando against the appointment — I did not give 
the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was 
very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. 
But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this 
school, and especially not in a position of power.” 

“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he 
want to teach?” 

Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before 
Dumbledore gave it. 

“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at 
the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea 
Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly 
fifty years. 

“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all 
the staff who had admired him said what a waste it 
was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a 
shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. 
Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given 
particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place 
like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you 
know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful 
Page |486 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to 
part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and 
he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing 
this.” 

“I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain 
himself. 

“Well, quite,” said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. 
“And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, 
who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the 
name of Hepzibah Smith.” 

Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork 
flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the 
Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After you, Harry.” 

Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the 
rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his 
face touched them. He tumbled through dark 
nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of 
an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger 
wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all 
around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. 
She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and 
dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a 
large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house- 
elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight 
satin slippers. 

“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously. “He 
said he’d come at four, it’s only a couple of minutes to 
and he’s never been late yet!” 

She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf 
straightened up. The top of the elf’s head barely 
reached the seat of Hepzibah ’s chair, and her papery 
skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet 
she wore draped like a toga. 

Page | 487 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“How do I look?” said Hepzibah, turning her head to 
admire the various angles of her face in the mirror. 

“Lovely, madam,” squeaked Hokey. 

Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s 
contract that she must lie through her teeth when 
asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked 
a long way from lovely in his opinion. 

A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf 
jumped. 

“Quick, quick, he’s here, Hokey!” cried Hepzibah and 
the elf scurried out of the room, which was so 
crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how 
anybody could navigate their way across it without 
knocking over at least a dozen things: There were 
cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of 
gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial 
globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass 
containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross 
between a magical antique shop and a conservatory. 

The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a 
tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in 
recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a 
black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had 
been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all 
of this suited him; he looked more handsome than 
ever. He picked his way through the cramped room 
with an air that showed he had visited many times 
before and bowed low over Hepzibah ’s fat little hand, 
brushing it with his lips. 

“I brought you flowers,” he said quietly, producing a 
bunch of roses from nowhere. 



Page | 488 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You naughty boy, you shouldn’t have!” squealed old 
Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an 
empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. 
“You do spoil this old lady, Tom. ... Sit down, sit 
down. ... Where’s Hokey? Ah ...” 

The house-elf had come dashing back into the room 
carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her 
mistress’s elbow. 

“Help yourself, Tom,” said Hepzibah, “I know how you 
love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They 
overwork you at that shop, I’ve said it a hundred 
times. ...” 

Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah 
simpered. 

“Well, what’s your excuse for visiting this time?” she 
asked, batting her lashes. 

“Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for 
the goblin-made armor,” said Voldemort. “Five 
hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair — ” 

“Now, now, not so fast, or I’ll think you’re only here 
for my trinkets!” pouted Hepzibah. 

“I am ordered here because of them,” said Voldemort 
quietly. “I am only a poor assistant, madam, who 
must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire 



“Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!” said Hepzibah, waving a 
little hand. “I’ve something to show you that I’ve never 
shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will 
you promise you won’t tell Mr. Burke I’ve got it? He’d 
never let me rest if he knew I’d shown it to you, and 
I’m not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, 
Page | 489 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Tom, you’ll appreciate it for its history, not how many 
Galleons you can get for it.” 

“I’d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,” 
said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another 
girlish giggle. 

“I had Hokey bring it out for me. ... Hokey, where are 
you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. ... 
In fact, bring both, while you’re at it. ...” 

“Here, madam,” squeaked the house-elf, and Harry 
saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, 
moving across the room as if of their own volition, 
though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over 
her head as she wended her way between tables, 
pouffes, and footstools. 

“Now,” said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from 
the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open 
the topmost one, “I think you’ll like this, Tom. ... Oh, 
if my family knew I was showing you. ... They can’t 
wait to get their hands on this!” 

She opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get 
a better view and saw what looked like a small golden 
cup with two finely wrought handles. 

“I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it 
up, have a good look!” whispered Hepzibah, and 
Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and 
lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken 
wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his 
dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously 
mirrored on Hepzibah’s face, except that her tiny eyes 
were fixed upon Voldemort’s handsome features. 

“A badger,” murmured Voldemort, examining the 
engraving upon the cup. “Then this was ... ?” 

Page | 490 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Helga Hufflepuff’s, as you very well know, you clever 
boy!” said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud 
creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow 
cheek. “Didn’t I tell you I was distantly descended? 
This has been handed down in the family for years 
and years. Lovely, isn’t it? And all sorts of powers it’s 
supposed to possess too, but I haven’t tested them 
thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. ...” 

She hooked the cup back off Voldemort’s long 
forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent 
upon settling it carefully back into position to notice 
the shadow that crossed Voldemort’s face as the cup 
was taken away. 

“Now then,” said Hepzibah happily, “where’s Hokey? 
Oh yes, there you are — take that away now, Hokey.” 

The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah 
turned her attention to the much flatter box in her 
lap. 

“I think you’ll like this even more, Tom,” she 
whispered. “Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. 
...Of course, Burke knows I’ve got this one, I bought 
it from him, and I daresay he’d love to get it back 
when I’m gone. ...” 

She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open 
the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a 
heavy golden locket. 

Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation 
this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it. 

“Slytherin’s mark,” he said quietly, as the light played 
upon an ornate, serpentine S. 



Page | 491 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s right!” said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at 
the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. 
“I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn’t let 
it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for 
my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a 
ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, 
but had no idea of its true value — ” 

There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort’s eyes 
flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his 
knuckles whiten on the locket’s chain. 

“ — I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you 
are. ... Pretty, isn’t it? And again, all kinds of powers 
attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. ...” 

She reached out to take the locket back. For a 
moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to 
let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers 
and was back in its red velvet cushion. 

“So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed 
that!” 

She looked him full in the face and for the first time, 
Harry saw her foolish smile falter. 

“Are you all right, dear?” 

“Oh yes,” said Voldemort quietly. “Yes, I’m very well. 



“I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose — ” 
said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed 
that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in 
Voldemort’s eyes. “Here, Hokey, take these away and 
lock them up again. ... The usual enchantments ...” 



Page | 492 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Time to leave, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly, and 
as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, 
Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the 
elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and 
back to Dumbledore ’s office. 

“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” 
said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating 
that Harry should do the same. “Hokey the house-elf 
was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her 
mistress’s evening cocoa by accident.” 

“No way!” said Harry angrily. 

“I see we are of one mind,” said Dumbledore. 
“Certainly, there are many similarities between this 
death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, 
somebody else took the blame, someone who had a 
clear memory of having caused the death — ” 

“Hokey confessed?” 

“She remembered putting something in her mistress’s 
cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal 
and little-known poison,” said Dumbledore. “It was 
concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being 
old and confused — ” 

“Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with 
Morfin!” 

“Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said Dumbledore. 
“And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was 
predisposed to suspect Hokey — ” 

“ — because she was a house-elf,” said Harry. He had 
rarely felt more in sympathy with the society 
Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. 



Page | 493 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Precisely,” said Dumbledore. “She was old, she 
admitted to having tampered with the drink, and 
nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As 
in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and 
managed to extract this memory, her life was almost 
over — but her memory, of course, proves nothing 
except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the 
cup and the locket. 

“By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah’s family 
had realized that two of her greatest treasures were 
missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for 
she had many hiding places, having always guarded 
her collection most jealously. But before they were 
sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were 
both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin 
and Burkes, the young man who had visited 
Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had 
resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no 
idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as 
anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last 
that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long 
time. 

“Now,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t mind, Harry, I 
want to pause once more to draw your attention to 
certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed 
another murder; whether it was his first since he 
killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. 
This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for 
revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous 
trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. 
Just as he had once robbed the other children at his 
orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin ’s 
ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibah’s cup and 
locket.” 

“But,” said Harry, frowning, “it seems mad. ... Risking 
everything, throwing away his job, just for those ...” 

Page | 494 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,” said 
Dumbledore. “I hope you will understand in due 
course exactly what those objects meant to him, 
Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to 
imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully 
his.” 

“The locket maybe,” said Harry, “but why take the 
cup as well?” 

“It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” 
said Dumbledore. “I think he still felt a great pull 
toward the school and that he could not resist an 
object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were 
other reasons, I think. ... I hope to be able to 
demonstrate them to you in due course. 

“And now for the very last recollection I have to show 
you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor 
Slughorn’s memory for us. Ten years separates 
Hokey’s memory and this one, ten years during which 
we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. 



Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore 
emptied the last memory into the Pensieve. 

“Whose memory is it?” he asked. 

“Mine,” said Dumbledore. 

And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the 
shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had 
just left. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his 
perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, 
who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing 
beside Harry, though both hands were whole and 
undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less 
lined. The one difference between the present-day 
Page | 495 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




office and this one was that it was snowing in the 
past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in 
the dark and building up on the outside ledge. 

The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for 
something, and sure enough, moments after their 
arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, 
“Enter.” 

Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had 
entered the room. His features were not those Harry 
had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron 
almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the 
eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, 
and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It 
was as though his features had been burned and 
blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the 
whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody 
look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that 
Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a 
long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the 
snow glistening on his shoulders. 

The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of 
surprise. Evidently this visit had been made by 
appointment. 

“Good evening, Tom,” said Dumbledore easily. “Won’t 
you sit down?” 

“Thank you,” said Voldemort, and he took the seat to 
which Dumbledore had gestured — the very seat, by 
the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the 
present. “I heard that you had become headmaster,” 
he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder 
than it had been. “A worthy choice.” 

“I am glad you approve,” said Dumbledore, smiling. 
“May I offer you a drink?” 

Page | 496 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That would be welcome,” said Voldemort. “I have 
come a long way.” 

Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet 
where he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was 
full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of 
wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the 
seat behind his desk. 

“So, Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure?” 

Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped 
his wine. 

“They do not call me Tom’ anymore,” he said. “These 
days, I am known as — ” 

“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, 
smiling pleasantly. “But to me, I’m afraid, you will 
always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things 
about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite 
forget their charges’ youthful beginnings.” 

He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, 
whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, 
Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: 
Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen 
name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the 
terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that 
Voldemort took it as such. 

“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said 
Voldemort after a short pause. “I always wondered 
why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave 
school.” 

“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard 
such as myself, there can be nothing more important 
than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young 

Page | 497 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the 
attraction of teaching too.” 

“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why 
you — who are so often asked for advice by the 
Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered 
the post of Minister — ” 

“Three times at the last count, actually,” said 
Dumbledore. “But the Ministry never attracted me as 
a career. Again, something we have in common, I 
think.” 

Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took 
another sip of wine. Dumbledore did not break the 
silence that stretched between them now, but waited, 
with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to 
talk first. 

“I have returned,” he said, after a little while, “later, 
perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected ... but I have 
returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once 
told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to 
ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to 
teach. I think you must know that I have seen and 
done much since I left this place. I could show and 
tell your students things they can gain from no other 
wizard.” 

Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his 
own goblet for a while before speaking. 

“Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done 
much since leaving us,” he said quietly. “Rumors of 
your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I 
should be sorry to believe half of them.” 



Page | 498 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Voldemort ’s expression remained impassive as he 
said, “Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, 
spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.” 

“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do 
you?” asked Dumbledore delicately. 

“Certainly,” said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to 
burn red. “I have experimented; I have pushed the 
boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have 
ever been pushed — ” 

“Of some kinds of magic,” Dumbledore corrected him 
quietly. “Of some. Of others, you remain ... forgive me 
... woefully ignorant.” 

For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut 
leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of 
rage. 

“The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I 
have seen in the world has supported your famous 
pronouncements that love is more powerful than my 
kind of magic, Dumbledore.” 

“Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” 
suggested Dumbledore. 

“Well, then, what better place to start my fresh 
researches than here, at Hogwarts?” said Voldemort. 
“Will you let me return? Will you let me share my 
knowledge with your students? I place myself and my 
talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.” 

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “And what will 
become of those whom you command? What will 
happen to those who call themselves — or so rumor 
has it — the Death Eaters?” 



Page | 499 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected 
Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort’s 
eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare. 

“My friends,” he said, after a moment’s pause, “will 
carry on without me, I am sure.” 

“I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,” 
said Dumbledore. “I was under the impression that 
they are more in the order of servants.” 

“You are mistaken,” said Voldemort. 

“Then if I were to go to the Hog’s Head tonight, I 
would not find a group of them — Nott, Rosier, 
Mulciber, Dolohov — awaiting your return? Devoted 
friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy 
night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to 
secure a teaching post.” 

There could be no doubt that Dumbledore ’s detailed 
knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was 
even less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied 
almost at once. 

“You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.” 

“Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said 
Dumbledore lightly. “Now, Tom ...” 

Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew 
himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together 
in a very characteristic gesture. 

“Let us speak openly. Why have you come here 
tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job 
we both know you do not want?” 



Page | 500 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Voldemort looked coldly surprised. “A job I do not 
want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very 
much.” 



“Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do 
not want to teach any more than you wanted to when 
you were eighteen. What is it you’re after, Tom? Why 
not try an open request for once?” 

Voldemort sneered. “If you do not want to give me a 
job -” 



“Of course I don’t,” said Dumbledore. “And I don’t 
think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, 
you came here, you asked, you must have had a 
purpose.” 

Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle 
than ever, his features thick with rage. “This is your 
final word?” 

“It is,” said Dumbledore, also standing. 

“Then we have nothing more to say to each other.” 

“No, nothing,” said Dumbledore, and a great sadness 
filled his face. “The time is long gone when I could 
frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you 
to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I 
could, Tom. ... I wish I could. ...” 

For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a 
pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemort’s hand 
had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but 
then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned 
away, the door was closing, and he was gone. 

Harry felt Dumbledore ’s hand close over his arm 
again and moments later, they were standing together 

Page | 501 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




on almost the same spot, but there was no snow 
building on the window ledge, and Dumbledore’s 
hand was blackened and dead-looking once more. 

“Why?” said Harry at once, looking up into 
Dumbledore’s face. “Why did he come back? Did you 
ever find out?” 

“I have ideas,” said Dumbledore, “but no more than 
that.” 

“What ideas, sir?” 

“I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that 
memory from Professor Slughorn,” said Dumbledore. 
“When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, 
everything will, I hope, be clear ... to both of us.” 

Harry was still burning with curiosity and even 
though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was 
holding it open for him, he did not move at once. 

“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job 
again, sir? He didn’t say. ...” 

“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the 
Dark Arts job,” said Dumbledore. “The aftermath of 
our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never 
been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts 
teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post 
to Lord Voldemort.”

THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 

Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to 
how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the 
true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain 
wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he 
did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring 
over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would 
have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he 
had done so many times before. 

“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione 
firmly, late on Sunday evening. 

“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been 
for the Prince, Ron wouldn’t be sitting here now.” 

“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first 
year,” said Hermione dismissively. 

Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation 
(“ Sectumsempral”) scrawled in a margin above the 
intriguing words “For Enemies,” and was itching to 



Page | 503 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



try it out, but thought it best not to in front of 
Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the 
corner of the page. 

They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; 
the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. 
There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier 
when they had come back from dinner to find a new 
sign on the notice board that announced the date for 
their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen 
on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of 
April, had the option of signing up for additional 
practice sessions, which would take place (heavily 
supervised) in Hogsmeade. 

Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still 
not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be 
ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved 
Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but 
Harry, who would not be seventeen for another four 
months, could not take the test whether ready or not. 

“At least you can Apparate, though!” said Ron tensely. 
“You’ll have no trouble come July!” 

“I’ve only done it once,” Harry reminded him; he had 
finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside 
his hoop during their previous lesson. 

Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about 
Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a 
viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and 
Hermione had already completed. Harry fully 
expected to receive low marks on his, because he had 
disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle 
dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory 
was the most important thing to him now. 



Page | 504 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be 
able to help you with this, Harry!” said Hermione, 
more loudly. “There’s only one way to force someone 
to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, 
which is illegal — ” 

“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking 
up from the book. “That’s why I’m looking for 
something different. Dumbledore says Veritaserum 
won’t do it, but there might be something else, a 
potion or a spell. ...” 

“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. 
“Only you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. 

That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where 
other people can’t. It’s not a question of slipping him 
a potion, anyone could do that — ” 

“How d’you spell ‘belligerent’?” said Ron, shaking his 
quill very hard while staring at his parchment. “It 
can’t be B — U — M — ” 

“No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s essay 
toward her. “And ‘augury’ doesn’t begin O — R — G 
either. What kind of quill are you using?” 

“It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones ... but 
I think the charm must be wearing off. ...” 

“Yes, it must,” said Hermione, pointing at the title of 
his essay, “because we were asked how we’d deal with 
dementors, not ‘Dugbogs,’ and I don’t remember you 
changing your name to ‘Roonil Wazlib’ either.” 

“Ah no!” said Ron, staring horror-struck at the 
parchment. “Don’t say I’ll have to write the whole 
thing out again!” 



Page | 505 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s okay, we can fix it,” said Hermione, pulling the 
essay toward her and taking out her wand. 

“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sinking back in his 
chair, rubbing his eyes wearily. 

Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t 
let Lavender hear you saying that.” 

“I won’t,” said Ron into his hands. “Or maybe I will ... 
then she’ll ditch me ...” 

“Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” 
asked Harry. 

“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said 
Ron. “You and Cho just — ” 

“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry 

“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” 
said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently 
tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of 
her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the 
page. “But the more I hint I want to finish it, the 
tighter she holds on. It’s like going out with the giant 
squid.” 

“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, 
handing back Ron’s essay. 

“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill 
for the conclusion?” 

Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half- 
Blood Prince’s notes so far, looked around; the three 
of them were now the only ones left in the common 
room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing 
Snape and his essay. The only sounds were the 
Page | 506 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last 
paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. 

Harry had just closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, 
yawning, when — 

Crack. 

Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all 
over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, 
“Kreacher!” 

The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own 
gnarled toes. 

“Master said he wanted regular reports on what the 
Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to give — ” 

Crack. 

Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat 
askew. 

“Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!” he 
squeaked, casting Kreacher a resentful look. “And 
Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to 
see Harry Potter so they can make their reports 
together!” 

“What is this?” asked Hermione, still looking shocked 
by these sudden appearances. “What’s going on, 
Harry?” 

Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not 
told Hermione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to 
tail Malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy 
subject with her. 

“Well ... they’ve been following Malfoy for me,” he 
said. 

Page | 507 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Night and day,” croaked Kreacher. 

“Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!” said 
Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood. 

Hermione looked indignant. 

“You haven’t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you 
didn’t tell him not to — ” 

“No, of course I didn’t,” said Harry quickly. “Dobby, 
you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found 
out anything?” he hastened to ask, before Hermione 
could intervene again. 

“Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his 
pure blood,” croaked Kreacher at once. “His features 
recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners 
are those of — ” 

“Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily. 
“A bad boy who — who — ” 

He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the 
toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though 
about to dive into it; Harry, to whom this was not 
entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle 
and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby 
struggled, then went limp. 

“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted. “Dobby still 
finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters. ...” 

Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy 
and said defiantly to Kreacher, “But Kreacher should 
know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a 
house-elf!” 



Page | 508 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love 
with Malfoy,” Harry told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward 
to where he’s actually been going.” 

Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, 
“Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a 
dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his classes in 
a variety of — ” 

“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across 
Kreacher. “Has he been going anywhere he shouldn’t 
have?” 

“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike 
eyes shining in the firelight, “the Malfoy boy is 
breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is 
still keen to avoid detection. He has been making 
regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of 
other students, who keep watch for him while he 
enters — ” 

“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking 
himself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion- 
Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him. “That’s 
where he’s been sneaking off to! That’s where he’s 
doing ... whatever he’s doing! And I bet that’s why 
he’s been disappearing off the map — come to think 
of it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on 
there!” 

“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was 
there,” said Ron. 

“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said 
Hermione. “If you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.” 

“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at 
what Malfoy’s doing?” said Harry eagerly. 



Page | 509 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby. 



“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our 
headquarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in 
and spy on him, no problem.” 

“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione 
slowly. “Malfoy already knew exactly how we were 
using the room, didn’t he, because that stupid 
Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become 
the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t 
know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in 
there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform 
into.” 

“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry 
dismissively. “You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby.” 

“Kreacher’s done well too,” said Hermione kindly; but 
far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, 
bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, “The 
Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will 
pretend he cannot hear — ” 

“Get out of it,” Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher 
made one last deep bow and Disapparated. “You’d 
better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.” 

“Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby 
happily, and he too vanished. 

“How good’s this?” said Harry enthusiastically, 
turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room 
was elf-free again. “We know where Malfoy’s going! 
We’ve got him cornered now!” 

“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glumly, who was 
attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that 
had recently been an almost completed essay. 

Page | 510 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning 
the ink off with her wand. 

“But what’s all this about him going up there with a 
Variety of students’?” said Hermione. “How many 
people are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust lots 
of them to know what he’s doing. ...” 

“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard 
him telling Crabbe it wasn’t Crabbe’s business what 
he was doing ... so what’s he telling all these ... all 
these ...” 

Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire. 

“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, 
isn’t it? There was a great vat of it down in the 
dungeon. ... He could’ve nicked some any time during 
that lesson. ...” 

“Nicked what?” said Ron. 

“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice 
Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions 
lesson. ... There aren’t a whole variety of students 
standing guard for Malfoy ... it’s just Crabbe and 
Goyle as usual. ... Yeah, it all fits!” said Harry, 
jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. 
“They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if 
he won’t tell them what he’s up to ... but he doesn’t 
want them to be seen lurking around outside the 
Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking 
Polyjuice to make them look like other people. ... 
Those two girls I saw him with when he missed 
Quidditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle!” 

“Do you mean to say,” said Hermione in a hushed 
voice, “that that little girl whose scales I repaired — ?” 



Page | 511 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, of course!” said Harry loudly, staring at her. 
“Of course! Malfoy must’ve been inside the room at 
the time, so she — what am I talking about? — he 
dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out, 
because there was someone there! And there was that 
girl who dropped the toadspawn too! We’ve been 
walking past him all the time and not realizing it!” 

“He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?” 
guffawed Ron. “Blimey ... No wonder they don’t look 
too happy these days. ... I’m surprised they don’t tell 
him to stuff it. ...” 

“Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them 
his Dark Mark?” said Harry. 

“Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said 
Hermione skeptically, rolling up Ron’s dried essay 
before it could come to any more harm and handing it 
to him. 

“Well see,” said Harry confidently. 

“Yes, we will,” Hermione said, getting to her feet and 
stretching. “But, Harry, before you get all excited, I 
still don’t think you’ll be able to get into the Room of 
Requirement without knowing what’s there first. And 
I don’t think you should forget” — she heaved her bag 
onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look — 
“that what you’re supposed to be concentrating on is 
getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.” 

Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. 
Once the door to the girls’ dormitories had closed 
behind her he rounded on Ron. 

“What d’you think?” 



Page | 512 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,” said Ron, 
staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished. “I’d 
have that Apparition Test in the bag.” 

Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for 
what felt like hours, wondering how Malfoy was using 
the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would 
see when he went in there the following day, for 
whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if 
Malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the 
D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy ’s ... what could it 
be? A meeting place? A hideout? A storeroom? A 
workshop? Harry’s mind worked feverishly and his 
dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and 
disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into 
Slughorn, who turned into Snape. ... 

Harry was in a state of great anticipation over 
breakfast the following morning; he had a free period 
before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was 
determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of 
Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously 
showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing 
entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he 
thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to. 

“Look,” he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a 
hand on the Daily Prophet, which she had just 
removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it 
and vanishing behind it. “I haven’t forgotten about 
Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that 
memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why 
shouldn’t I find out what Malfoy’s doing?” 

“I’ve already told you, you need to persuade 
Slughorn,” said Hermione. “It’s not a question of 
tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could 
have done it in a second. Instead of messing around 
outside the Room of Requirement” — she jerked the 
Page | 513 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




Prophet out from under Harry’s hand and unfolded it 
to look at the front page — “you should go and find 
Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.” 

“Anyone we know — ?” asked Ron, as Hermione 
scanned the headlines. 

“Yes!” said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to 
gag on their breakfast. “But it’s all right, he’s not 
dead — it’s Mundungus, he’s been arrested and sent 
to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an 
Inferius during an attempted burglary . . . and 
someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. ... Oh, 
and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been 
arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think 
he was under the Imperius Curse. ...” 

They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set 
off immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the 
common room, where he still had to finish his 
conclusion on Snape’s dementor essay; and Harry for 
the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of 
wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy 
teaching trolls to do ballet. 

Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had 
found an empty passage, but he need not have 
bothered. When he reached his destination he found 
it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances 
of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy 
inside it or out, but at least his first attempt was not 
going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or 
Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl. 

He closed his eyes as he approached the place where 
the Room of Requirement’s door was concealed. He 
knew what he had to do; he had become most 
accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all 
his might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy ’s 
Page | 514 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




doing in here. ... I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in 
here. ... I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. ... 

Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart 
pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and 
faced it — 

But he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely 
blank wall. 

He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. 
The stone remained solid and unyielding. 

“Okay,” said Harry aloud. “Okay ... I thought the 
wrong thing. ...” 

He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes 
closed, concentrating as hard as he could. 

I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming 
secretly. ... I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps 
coming secretly. . . . 

After three walks past, he opened his eyes 
expectantly. 

There was no door. 

“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall irritably. “That was 
a clear instruction. ... Fine ...” 

He thought hard for several minutes before striding 
off once more. 

I need you to become the place you become for Draco 
Malfoy. ... 

He did not immediately open his eyes when he had 
finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as 

Page | 515 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




though he might hear the door pop into existence. He 
heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering 
of birds outside. He opened his eyes. 

There was still no door. 

Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to 
see a gaggle of first years running back around the 
corner, apparently under the impression that they 
had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed 
ghost. 

Harry tried every variation of “I need to see what 
Draco Malfoy is doing inside you” that he could think 
of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced 
to concede that Hermione might have had a point: 

The room simply did not want to open for him. 
Frustrated and annoyed, he set off for Defense 
Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak 
and stuffing it into his bag as he went. 

“Late again, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry 
hurried into the candlelit classroom. “Ten points from 
Gryffindor.” 

Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the 
seat beside Ron; half the class was still on its feet, 
taking out books and organizing their things; he 
could not be much later than any of them. 

“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said 
Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twenty- 
five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and 
landed in a neat pile on his desk. “And I hope for your 
sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure 
on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all 
open your books to page — what is it, Mr. Finnigan?” 



Page | 516 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sir,” said Seamus, “I’ve been wondering, how do you 
tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? 
Because there was something in the paper about an 
Inferius — ” 

“No, there wasn’t,” said Snape in a bored voice. 

“But sir, I heard people talking — ” 

“If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. 
Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called 
Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the 
name of Mundungus Fletcher.” 

“I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same 
side,” muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione. 
“Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest 



“But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” 
said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the 
room, his black eyes fixed on Harry “Let us ask Potter 
how we would tell the difference between an Inferius 
and a ghost.” 

The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily 
tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the 
night that they had gone to visit Slughorn. 

“Er — well — ghosts are transparent — ” he said. 

“Oh, very good,” interrupted Snape, his lip curling. 
“Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical 
education have not been wasted on you, Potter. 
‘Ghosts are transparent.’ ” 

Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several 
other people were smirking. Harry took a deep breath 
and continued calmly, though his insides were 

Page | 517 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




boiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are 
dead bodies, aren’t they? So they’d be solid — ” 

“A five-year-old could have told us as much,” sneered 
Snape. “The Inferius is a corpse that has been 
reanimated by a Dark wizard’s spells. It is not alive, it 
is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard’s 
bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by 
now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the 
earth ... and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, 
transparent.” 

“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re 
trying to tell them apart!” said Ron. “When we come 
face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we’re going to 
be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re 
not going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the 
imprint of a departed soul?’ ” 

There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by 
the look Snape gave the class. 

“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I 
would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, 
Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate 
half an inch across a room.” 

“IVo!” whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as 
he opened his mouth furiously. “There’s no point, 
you’ll just end up in detention again, leave it!” 

“Now open your books to page two hundred and 
thirteen,” said Snape, smirking a little, “and read the 
first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse. ...” 

Ron was very subdued all through the class. When 
the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender 
caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione 
mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached)

and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron’s 
Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, 
and he shook her off by making a detour into the 
boys’ bathroom with Harry. 

“Snape’s right, though, isn’t he?” said Ron, after 
staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. “I 
dunno whether it’s worth me taking the test. I just 
can’t get the hang of Apparition.” 

“You might as well do the extra practice sessions in 
Hogsmeade and see where they get you,” said Harry 
reasonably. “It’ll be more interesting than trying to get 
into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you’re still not — 
you know — as good as you’d like to be, you can 
postpone the test, do it with me over the summ — 
Myrtle, this is the boys’ bathroom!” 

The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a 
cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, 
staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. 

“Oh,” she said glumly. “It’s you two.” 

“Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in 
the mirror. 

“Nobody,” said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on 
her chin. “He said he’d come back and see me, but 
then you said you’d pop in and visit me too” — she 
gave Harry a reproachful look — “and I haven’t seen 
you for months and months. I’ve learned not to expect 
too much from boys.” 

“I thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom?” said 
Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide 
berth for some years now. 



Page | 519 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I do,” she said, with a sulky little shrug, “but that 
doesn’t mean I can’t visit other places. I came and 
saw you in your bath once, remember?” 

“Vividly,” said Harry. 

“But I thought he liked me,” she said plaintively. 
“Maybe if you two left, he’d come back again. ... We 
had lots in common. ... I’m sure he felt it. ...” 

And she looked hopefully toward the door. 

“When you say you had lots in common,” said Ron, 
sounding rather amused now, “d’you mean he lives in 
an S-bend too?” 

“No,” said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly 
around the old tiled bathroom. “I mean he’s sensitive, 
people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn’t 
got anybody to talk to, and he’s not afraid to show his 
feelings and cry!” 

“There’s been a boy in here crying?” said Harry 
curiously. “A young boy?” 

“Never you mind!” said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes 
fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. “I 
promised I wouldn’t tell anyone, and I’ll take his 
secret to the — ” 

“ — not the grave, surely?” said Ron with a snort. “The 
sewers, maybe ...” 

Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the 
toilet, causing water to slop over the sides and onto 
the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh 
heart into Ron. 



Page | 520 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back 
over his shoulder, “I’ll do the practice sessions in 
Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.” 

And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione 
and the rest of the sixth years who would turn 
seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry 
felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go 
into the village; he missed making trips there, and it 
was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first 
clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he 
had decided to use the time to attempt another 
assault on the Room of Requirement. 

“You’d do better,” said Hermione, when he confided 
this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, “to go 
straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get that 
memory from him.” 

“I’ve been trying!” said Harry crossly, which was 
perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every 
Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner 
Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the 
dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch 
him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, 
but received no reply, though on the second occasion 
he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds 
of an old gramophone. 

“He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell 
I’ve been trying to get him on his own again, and he’s 
not going to let it happen!” 

“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?” 

The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, 
who was doing his usual prodding act with the 
Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry 
did not answer in case he was overheard by the 

Page | 521 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, 
then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, 
determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an 
hour or two to the Room of Requirement. 

Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled 
the Marauder’s Map and his Invisibility Cloak from 
his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the 
map, murmured, “ I solemnly swear that I am up to no 
good,” and scanned it carefully. 

As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students 
were inside their various common rooms, the 
Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, 
the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in 
the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a 
stray person meandered around the library or up a 
corridor. . . . There were a few people out in the 
grounds ... and there, alone in the seventh-floor 
corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the 
Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried 
about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the 
room was open, whether the map was aware of it or 
not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down 
only when he reached the corner into the corridor, 
when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very 
same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that 
Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He 
waited until he was right behind her before bending 
very low and whispering, “Hello ... you’re very pretty, 
aren’t you?” 

Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the 
scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing 
from sight long before the sound of the scales 
smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. 
Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall 
behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now 
standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was 
Page | 522 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It 
gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he 
tried to remember what form of words he had not yet 
tried. 

Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour 
later, having tried many more variations of his 
request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was 
just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond 
belief; Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and 
there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to 
what he was doing in there. Losing his patience 
completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it. 

“OUCH!” 

He thought he might have broken his toe; as he 
clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility 
Cloak slipped off him. 

“Harry?” 

He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, 
to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward 
him as though she frequently strolled up this 
corridor. 

“What’re you doing here?” he said, scrambling to his 
feet again; why did she always have to find him lying 
on the floor? 

“I came to see Dumbledore,” said Tonks. 

Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than 
usual, her mouse-colored hair lank. 

“His office isn’t here,” said Harry, “it’s round the other 
side of the castle, behind the gargoyle — ” 



Page | 523 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I know,” said Tonks. “He’s not there. Apparently he’s 
gone away again.” 

“Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly 
back on the floor. “Hey — you don’t know where he 
goes, I suppose?” 

“No,” said Tonks. 

“What did you want to see him about?” 

“Nothing in particular,” said Tonks, picking, 
apparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe. “I 
just thought he might know what’s going on. ... I’ve 
heard rumors ... people getting hurt ...” 

“Yeah, I know, it’s all been in the papers,” said Harry. 
“That little kid trying to kill his — ” 

“The Prophet’s often behind the times,” said Tonks, 
who didn’t seem to be listening to him. “You haven’t 
had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?” 

“No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said 
Harry, “not since Sirius — ” 

He saw that her eyes had filled with tears. 

“I’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly. “I mean ... I miss 
him, as well. ...” 

“What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not 
heard him. “Well ... I’ll see you around, Harry ...” 

And she turned abruptly and walked back down the 
corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her. After a 
minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again 
and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of 
Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a 
Page | 524 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that 
Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch 
made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor 
to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave 
for some hours to come. 

He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, 
already halfway through an early lunch. 

“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Harry 
enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. “I was 
supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam 
Puddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up 
near Scrivenshaft’s, but at least I moved!” 

“Good one,” said Harry. “How’d you do, Hermione?” 

“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before 
Hermione could answer. “Perfect deliberation, 
divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is 
— we all went for a quick drink in the Three 
Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross 
going on about her — I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t 
pop the question soon — ” 

“And what about you?” asked Hermione, ignoring 
Ron. “Have you been up at the Room of Requirement 
all this time?” 

“Yep,” said Harry. “And guess who I ran into up 
there? Tonks!” 

“Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, 
looking surprised. 

“Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore. ...” 

“If you ask me,” said Ron once Harry had finished 
describing his conversation with Tonks, “she’s 

Page | 525 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what 
happened at the Ministry.” 

“It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some reason 
looked very concerned. “She’s supposed to be 
guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning 
her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not 
even here?” 

“I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively. He felt 
strange about voicing it; this was much more 
Hermione’s territory than his. “You don’t think she 
can have been . . . you know ... in love with Sirius?” 

Hermione stared at him. 

“What on earth makes you say that?” 

“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging, “but she was nearly 
crying when I mentioned his name . . . and her 
Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. ... I wondered 
whether it hadn’t become ... you know ... him.” 

“It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly. “But I still 
don’t know why she’d be bursting into the castle to 
see Dumbledore, if that’s really why she was here. ...” 

“Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who 
was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. 
“She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,” he 
said wisely to Harry, “they’re easily upset.” 

“And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I 
doubt you’d find a woman who sulked for half an 
hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t laugh at their 
joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus 
mimbletonia.” 

Ron scowled.

AFTER THE BURIAL 

Patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear 
over the castle turrets, but these signs of approaching 
summer did not lift Harry’s mood. He had been 
thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what 
Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a 
conversation with Slughorn that might lead, 
somehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he 
had apparently suppressed for decades. 

“For the last time, just forget about Malfoy,” Hermione 
told Harry firmly. 

They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the 
courtyard after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both 
clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet — Common 
Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them — for 
they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but 
by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to 
the nerves. 



Page | 527 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as 
a girl came around the corner. 

“It isn’t Lavender,” said Hermione wearily. 

“Oh, good,” said Ron, relaxing. 

“Harry Potter?” said the girl. “I was asked to give you 
this.” 

“Thanks ...” 

Harry’s heart sank as he took the small scroll of 
parchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, 
“Dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any more 
lessons until I got the memory!” 

“Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” 
suggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the 
parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledore ’s 
long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy 
sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of 
large blotches on the parchment where the ink had 
run. 



Dear Harry, Ron, and Hermione, 

Aragog died last night Harry and Ron, you met him, 
and you know how special he was. Hermione, I know 
you’d have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if 
you’d nip down for the burial later this evening. I’m 
planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite 
time of day. I know you’re not supposed to be out that 
late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldn’t ask, but I 
can’t face it alone. 



Hagrid 

Page | 528 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Look at this,” said Harry, handing the note to 
Hermione. 

“Oh, for heaven’s sake,” she said, scanning it quickly 
and passing it to Ron, who read it through looking 
increasingly incredulous. 

“He’s mentaft” he said furiously. “That thing told its 
mates to eat Harry and me! Told them to help 
themselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go down 
there and cry over its horrible hairy body!” 

“It’s not just that,” said Hermione. “He’s asking us to 
leave the castle at night and he knows security’s a 
million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in 
if we were caught.” 

“We’ve been down to see him by night before,” said 
Harry. 

“Yes, but for something like this?” said Hermione. 
“We’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all — 
Aragog’s dead. If it were a question of saving him — ” 

“ — I’d want to go even less,” said Ron firmly. “You 
didn’t meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead 
will have improved him a lot.” 

Harry took the note back and stared down at all the 
inky blotches all over it. Tears had clearly fallen thick 
and fast upon the parchment. ... 

“Harry, you can’t be thinking of going,” said 
Hermione. “It’s such a pointless thing to get detention 
for.” 

Harry sighed. “Yeah, I know,” he said. “I s’pose 
Hagrid ’ll have to bury Aragog without us.” 



Page | 529 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, he will,” said Hermione, looking relieved. “Look, 
Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us 
all off doing our tests. ... Try and soften Slughorn up 
a bit then!” 

“Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think?” said Harry 
bitterly. 

“Lucky,” said Ron suddenly. “Harry, that’s it — get 
lucky!” 

“What d’you mean?” 

“Use your lucky potion!” 

“Ron, that’s — that’s it!” said Hermione, sounding 
stunned. “Of course! Why didn’t I think of it?” 

Harry stared at them both. “Felix Felicis?” he said. “I 
dunno ... I was sort of saving it. ...” 

“What for?” demanded Ron incredulously. 

“What on earth is more important than this memory, 
Harry?” asked Hermione. 

Harry did not answer. The thought of that little golden 
bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for 
some time; vague and unformulated plans that 
involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron 
somehow being happy to see her with a new 
boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his 
brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the 
twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . . 

“Harry? Are you still with us?” asked Hermione. 

“Wha — ? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling himself 
together. “Well ... okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk 

Page | 530 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




this afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and have another 
go this evening.” 

“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting 
to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. 
“Destination ... determination ... deliberation ...” she 
murmured. 

“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as 
it is — quick, hide me!” 

“It isn’t Lavender!” said Hermione impatiently, as 
another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and 
Ron dived behind her. 

“Cool,” said Ron, peering over Hermione’s shoulder to 
check. “Blimey, they don’t look happy, do they?” 

“They’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they 
don’t look happy, didn’t you hear what happened to 
their little brother?” said Hermione. 

“I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s 
relatives, to be honest,” said Ron. 

“Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The 
rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death 
Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in 
St. Mungo’s, they couldn’t save him.” 

“He died?” repeated Harry, shocked. “But surely 
werewolves don’t kill, they just turn you into one of 
them?” 

“They sometimes kill,” said Ron, who looked 
unusually grave now. “I’ve heard of it happening 
when the werewolf gets carried away.” 

“What was the werewolf’s name?” said Harry quickly. 

Page | 531 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,” 
said Hermione. 

“I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids, the 
one Lupin told me about!” said Harry angrily. 

Hermione looked at him bleakly. 

“Harry, you’ve got to get that memory,” she said. “It’s 
all about stopping Voldemort, isn’t it? These dreadful 
things that are happening are all down to him. ...” 

The bell rang overhead in the castle and both 
Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking 
terrified. 

“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed 
toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people 
taking their Apparition Test. “Good luck.” 

“And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, 
as Harry headed off to the dungeons. 

There were only three of them in Potions that 
afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and Draco Malfoy. 

“All too young to Apparate just yet?” said Slughorn 
genially. “Not turned seventeen yet?” 

They shook their heads. 

“Ah well,” said Slughorn cheerily, “as we’re so few, 
we’ll do something fun. I want you all to brew me up 
something amusing!” 

“That sounds good, sir,” said Ernie sycophantically, 
rubbing his hands together. Malfoy, on the other 
hand, did not crack a smile. 



Page | 532 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What do you mean, ‘something amusing?” he said 
irritably. 

“Oh, surprise me,” said Slughorn airily. 

Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making 
with a sulky expression. It could not have been 
plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of 
time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching him over 
the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the 
time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of 
Requirement. 

Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look 
thinner? Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had 
that grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw 
daylight these days. But there was no air of 
smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the 
swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, 
when he had boasted openly of the mission he had 
been given by Voldemort. ... There could be only one 
conclusion, in Harry’s opinion: The mission, whatever 
it was, was going badly. 

Cheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his 
copy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily 
corrected Half-Blood Prince’s version of “An Elixir to 
Induce Euphoria,” which seemed not only to meet 
Slughorn ’s instructions, but which might (Harry’s 
heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn 
into such a good mood that he would be prepared to 
hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him 
to taste some. ... 

“Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,” said 
Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands 
together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow 
contents of Harry’s cauldron. “Euphoria, I take it? And 
what’s that I smell? Mmmm ... you’ve added just a 
Page | 533 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




sprig of peppermint, haven’t you? Unorthodox, but 
what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that 
would tend to counterbalance the occasional side 
effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. ... I 
really don’t know where you get these brain waves, 
my boy . . . unless — ” 

Harry pushed the Half-Blood Prince’s book deeper 
into his bag with his foot. 

“ — it’s just your mother’s genes coming out in you!” 

“Oh ... yeah, maybe,” said Harry, relieved. 

Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to 
outshine Harry for once, he had most rashly invented 
his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind 
of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. 
Malfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn 
had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely 
“passable.” 

The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once. 

“Sir,” Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced 
over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was 
empty but for himself and Harry, he hurried away as 
fast as he could. 

“Professor — Professor, don’t you want to taste my po 
— ?” called Harry desperately. 

But Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied 
the cauldron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, 
and walked slowly back upstairs to the common 
room. 

Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon. 



Page | 534 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry!” cried Hermione as she climbed through the 
portrait hole. “Harry, I passed!” 

“Well done!” he said. “And Ron?” 

“He — he just failed,” whispered Hermione, as Ron 
came slouching into the room looking most morose. 
“It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just 
spotted that he’d left half an eyebrow behind. ... How 
did it go with Slughorn?” 

“No joy,” said Harry, as Ron joined them. “Bad luck, 
mate, but you’ll pass next time — we can take it 
together.” 

“Yeah, I s’pose,” said Ron grumpily. “But half an 
eyebrow\ Like that matters!” 

“I know,” said Hermione soothingly, “it does seem 
really harsh. ...” 

They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the 
Apparition examiner, and Ron looked fractionally 
more cheerful by the time they set off back to the 
common room, now discussing the continuing 
problem of Slughorn and the memory. 

“So, Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or 
what?” Ron demanded. 

“Yeah, I s’pose I’d better,” said Harry. “I don’t reckon 
I’ll need all of it, not twelve hours’ worth, it can’t take 
all night. ... I’ll just take a mouthful. Two or three 
hours should do it.” 

“It’s a great feeling when you take it,” said Ron 
reminiscently. “Like you can’t do anything wrong.” 



Page | 535 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What are you talking about?” said Hermione, 
laughing. “You’ve never taken any!” 

“Yeah, but I thought I had, didn’t I?” said Ron, as 
though explaining the obvious. “Same difference 
really ...” 

As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great 
Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, 
they lingered for a while in the common room, the 
plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn ’s office 
once the teacher had had time to get back there. 
When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in 
the Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had 
come, and after checking carefully that Neville, Dean, 
and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked 
up to the boys’ dormitory. 

Harry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of 
his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle. 

“Well, here goes,” said Harry, and he raised the little 
bottle and took a carefully measured gulp. 

“What does it feel like?” whispered Hermione. 

Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but 
surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity 
stole through him; he felt as though he could have 
done anything, anything at all ... and getting the 
memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only 
possible, but positively easy. ... 

He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence. 

“Excellent,” he said. “Really excellent. Right ... I’m 
going down to Hagrid’s.” 



Page | 536 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What?” said Ron and Hermione together, looking 
aghast. 

“No, Harry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, 
remember?” said Hermione. 

“No,” said Harry confidently. “I’m going to Hagrid’s, 

I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s.” 

“You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant 
spider?” asked Ron, looking stunned. 

“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of 
his bag. “I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you 
know what I mean?” 

“No,” said Ron and Hermione together, both looking 
positively alarmed now. 

“This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?” said Hermione 
anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. “You 
haven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t know 



“Essence of Insanity?” suggested Ron, as Harry 
swung his cloak over his shoulders. 

Harry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even 
more alarmed. 

“Trust me,” he said. “I know what I’m doing ... or at 
least” — he strolled confidently to the door — “Felix 
does.” 

He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set 
off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along 
behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid 
through the open door. 



Page | 537 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What were you doing up there with her?” shrieked 
Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron 
and Hermione emerging together from the boys’ 
dormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him 
as he darted across the room away from them. 

Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he 
approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and 
Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he 
brushed accidentally against Ginny. 

“Don’t push me, please, Dean,” she said, sounding 
annoyed. “You’re always doing that, I can get through 
perfectly well on my own. ...” 

The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not 
before he had heard Dean make an angry retort. ... 

His feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off 
through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for 
he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise 
him in the slightest: This evening, he was the luckiest 
person at Hogwarts. 

Why he knew that going to Hagrid’s was the right 
thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the 
potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a 
time: He could not see the final destination, he could 
not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he 
was going the right way to get that memory. When he 
reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had 
forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw 
it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and 
grass for a moment before walking down the steps 
into the dusk. 

It was when he reached the bottom step that it 
occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass 
the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid’s. It was not 
strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that 

Page | 538 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




this was a whim on which he should act, so he 
directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable 
patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether 
surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation 
with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low 
stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and 
listening to their conversation. 

“I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,” 
Slughorn was saying courteously, “most authorities 
agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked 
at twilight.” 

“Oh, I quite agree,” said Professor Sprout warmly. 
“That enough for you?” 

“Plenty, plenty,” said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was 
carrying an armful of leafy plants. “This should allow 
for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some 
to spare if anybody over-stews them. ... Well, good 
evening to you, and many thanks again!” 

Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering 
darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and 
Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry 
stood, invisible. 

Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, 
Harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish. 

“Good evening, Professor.” 

“Merlin’s beard, Harry, you made me jump,” said 
Slughorn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking 
wary. “How did you get out of the castle?” 

“I think Filch must’ve forgotten to lock the doors,” 
said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see 
Slughorn scowl. 

Page | 539 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ll be reporting that man, he’s more concerned about 
litter than proper security if you ask me. ... But why 
are you out here, Harry?” 

“Well, sir, it’s Hagrid,” said Harry, who knew that the 
right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. “He’s 
pretty upset. ... But you won’t tell anyone, Professor? 

I don’t want trouble for him. ...” 

Slughorn’s curiosity was evidently aroused. “Well, I 
can’t promise that,” he said gruffly. “But I know that 
Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I’m sure he 
can’t be up to anything very dreadful. ...” 

“Well, it’s this giant spider, he’s had it for years. ... It 
lived in the forest. ... It could talk and everything — ” 

“I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the 
forest,” said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass 
of black trees. “It’s true, then?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. “But this one, Aragog, the first one 
Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He’s devastated. He 
wants company while he buries it and I said I’d go.” 

“Touching, touching,” said Slughorn absentmindedly, 
his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of 
Hagrid ’s cabin. “But acromantula venom is very 
valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet 
have dried out. ... Of course, I wouldn’t want to do 
anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset . . . but if there 
was any way to procure some ... I mean, it’s almost 
impossible to get venom from an acromantula while 
it’s alive. ...” 

Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than 
Harry now. 



Page | 540 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




"... seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get 
a hundred Galleons a pint. ... To be frank, my salary 
is not large. ...” 

And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. 

“Well,” he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, 
“well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would 
probably be really pleased. ... Give Aragog a better 
send-off, you know ...” 

“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn, his eyes now 
gleaming with enthusiasm. “I tell you what, Harry, I’ll 
meet you down there with a bottle or two. ... We’ll 
drink the poor beast’s — well — not health — but 
we’ll send it off in style, anyway, once it’s buried. And 
I’ll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the 
occasion. ...” 

He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to 
Hagrid ’s, delighted with himself. 

“Yeh came,” croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door 
and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in 
front of him. 

“Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though,” said 
Harry. “They’re really sorry.” 

“Don’ — don’ matter ... He’d’ve bin touched yeh’re 
here, though, Harry. ...” 

Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black 
armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot 
polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. 
Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was 
the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach. 

“Where are we burying him?” he asked. “The forest?” 

Page | 541 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Blimey, no,” said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes 
on the bottom of his shirt. “The other spiders won’ let 
me anywhere near their webs now Aragog’s gone. 
Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! 
Can yeh believe that, Harry?” 

The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with 
painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come 
face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been 
quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that 
stopped them from eating Hagrid. 

“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” 
said Hagrid, shaking his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ 
Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh — they 
usually eat their dead, see. ... But I wanted ter give 
’im a nice burial ... a proper send-off ...” 

He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the 
patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the 
potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing 
to do), “Professor Slughorn met me coming down 
here, Hagrid.” 

“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, 
alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the 
evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault — ” 

“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d 
like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,” 
said Harry. “He’s gone to change into something more 
suitable, I think ... and he said he’d bring some 
bottles so we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . . 

“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and 
touched. “Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ 
not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really had a lot ter 
do with Horace Slughorn before. ... Cornin’ ter see old 



Page | 542 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Aragog off, though, eh? Well ... he ’d’ve liked that, 
Aragog would. ...” 

Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have 
liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of 
edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the 
rear window of Hagrid ’s hut, where he saw the rather 
horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its 
back outside, its legs curled and tangled. 

“Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your 
garden?” 

“Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said 
Hagrid in a choked voice. “I’ve already dug the — yeh 
know — grave. Jus’ thought we’d say a few nice 
things over him — happy memories, yeh know — ” 

His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on 
the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose 
on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. 
Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles 
in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat. 

“Hagrid,” he said, in a deep, grave voice. “So very 
sorry to hear of your loss.” 

“Tha’s very nice of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Thanks a lot. 

An’ thanks fer not givin’ Harry detention neither. ...” 

“Wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said Slughorn. “Sad 
night, sad night ... Where is the poor creature?” 

“Out here,” said Hagrid in a shaking voice. “Shall we 
— shall we do it, then?” 

The three of them stepped out into the back garden. 
The moon was glistening palely through the trees 
now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from 

Page | 543 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on 
the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high 
mound of freshly dug earth. 

“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the 
spider’s head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly 
at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, 
motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard 
the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the 
pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy 
head. 

“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” 
said Hagrid to Slughorn ’s back, tears leaking from the 
corners of his crinkled eyes. “I didn’ know yeh were 
int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.” 

“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said 
Slughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry saw 
the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak, 
though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed 
nothing. “Now ... shall we proceed to the burial?” 

Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the 
gigantic spider into his arms and, with an enormous 
grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with 
a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry 
again. 

“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” 
said Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher 
than Hagrid’s elbow, but patted it all the same. “Why 
don’t I say a few words?” 

He must have got a lot of good quality venom from 
Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied 
smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, 
in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell, Aragog, king of 
arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those 
Page | 544 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




who knew you won’t forget! Though your body will 
decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun 
places of your forest home. May your many-eyed 
descendants ever flourish and your human friends 
find solace for the loss they have sustained.” 

“Tha’ was ... tha’ was ... beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, 
and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying 
harder than ever. 

“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so 
that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with 
a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming 
a smooth mound. “Let’s get inside and have a drink. 
Get on his other side, Harry. ... That’s it. ... Up you 
come, Hagrid ... Well done ...” 

They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, 
who had been skulking in his basket during the 
burial, now came padding softly across to them and 
put his heavy head into Harry’s lap as usual. 

Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had 
brought. 

“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured Harry, 
pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid ’s 
bucket- sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. “Had a 
house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to 
your poor friend Rupert.” 

Harry saw, in his mind’s eye, the expression on 
Hermione’s face if she ever heard about this abuse of 
house-elves, and decided never to mention it to her. 

“One for Harry ...” said Slughorn, dividing a second 
bottle between two mugs, "... and one for me. Well” — 
he raised his mug high — “to Aragog.” 

“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together. 

Page | 545 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, 
however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by 
Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he 
merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug 
back on the table before him. 

“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid 
morosely. “Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. 
Bout the size of a Pekingese.” 

“Sweet,” said Slughorn. 

“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school 
until ... well ...” 

Hagrid ’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom 
Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of 
school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. 
Slughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he 
was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of 
brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright 
white hair. 

“That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?” 

“Oh, yeah,” said Hagrid indifferently. “Gets pulled out 
of their tails, they catch it on branches an’ stuff in the 
forest, yeh know ...” 

“But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s 
worth?” 

“I use it fer bindin’ on bandages an’ stuff if a creature 
gets injured,” said Hagrid, shrugging. “It’s dead useful 
... very strong, see.” 

Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug, 
his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, 
looking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might 

Page | 546 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak- 
matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet 
smoking jackets. He refilled Hagrid’s mug and his 
own, and questioned him about the creatures that 
lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was 
able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming 
expansive under the influence of the drink and 
Slughorn ’s flattering interest, stopped mopping his 
eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of 
bowtruckle husbandry. 

The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this 
point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that 
Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry 
had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm 
without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea 
that he might not be able to do it tonight was 
laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, 
unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now 
swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he 
pointed his wand under the table at the emptying 
bottles and they immediately began to refill. 

After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began 
making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to 
Dumbledore, to elf-made wine, and to — 

“Harry Potter!” bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his 
fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he 
drained it. 

“Yes, indeed,” cried Slughorn a little thickly, “Parry 
Otter, the Chosen Boy Who — well — something of 
that sort,” he mumbled, and drained his mug too. 

Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and 
pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who 
pocketed it with cries of, “To friendship! To generosity! 
To ten Galleons a hair!” 

Page | 547 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were 
sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing 
a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo. 

“Aaargh, the good die young,” muttered Hagrid, 
slumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while 
Slughorn continued to warble the refrain. “Me dad 
was no age ter go ... nor were yer mum an’ dad, 
Harry...” 

Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid ’s 
crinkled eyes again; he grasped Harry’s arm and 
shook it. 

“Bes’ wiz and witchard o’ their age I never knew ... 
terrible thing ... terrible thing ...” 

And Odo the hero, they bore him back home 
To the place that he’d known as a lad, 

sang Slughorn plaintively. 

They laid him to rest with his hat inside out 
And his wand snapped in two, which was sad. 

"... terrible,” Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy 
head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, 
snoring deeply. 

“Sorry,” said Slughorn with a hiccup. “Can’t carry a 
tune to save my life.” 

“Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said Harry 
quietly. “He was talking about my mum and dad 
dying.” 

“Oh,” said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. “Oh 
dear. Yes, that was — was terrible indeed. Terrible ... 
terrible ...” 

Page | 548 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted 
to refilling their mugs. 



“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry?” he 
asked awkwardly. 

“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said 
Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in 
Hagrid’s heavy snores. “But I’ve found out pretty 
much what happened since. My dad died first. Did 
you know that?” 

“I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice. 

“Yeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped 
over his body toward my mum,” said Harry. 

Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem 
able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harry’s face. 

“He told her to get out of the way,” said Harry 
remorselessly. “He told me she needn’t have died. He 
only wanted me. She could have run.” 

“Oh dear,” breathed Slughorn. “She could have ... she 
needn’t ... That’s awful. ...” 

“It is, isn’t it?” said Harry, in a voice barely more than 
a whisper. “But she didn’t move. Dad was already 
dead, but she didn’t want me to go too. She tried to 
plead with Voldemort ... but he just laughed. ...” 

“That’s enough!” said Slughorn suddenly, raising a 
shaking hand. “Really, my dear boy, enough ... I’m an 
old man ... I don’t need to hear ... I don’t want to hear 



“I forgot,” lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. 

“You liked her, didn’t you?” 

Page | 549 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Liked her?” said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with 
tears once more. “I don’t imagine anyone who met her 
wouldn’t have liked her. ... Very brave ... Very funny 
...It was the most horrible thing. ...” 

“But you won’t help her son,” said Harry. “She gave 
me her life, but you won’t give me a memory.” 

Hagrid’s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry 
looked steadily into Slughorn ’s tear-filled eyes. The 
Potions master seemed unable to look away. 

“Don’t say that,” he whispered. “It isn’t a question ... 

If it were to help you, of course ... but no purpose can 
be served ...” 

“It can,” said Harry clearly. “Dumbledore needs 
information. I need information.” 

He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that 
Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the 
morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry 
leaned forward a little. 

“I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that 
memory.” 

Slughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead 
gleamed with sweat. 

“You are the Chosen One?” 

“Of course I am,” said Harry calmly. 

“But then ... my dear boy ... you’re asking a great deal 
... you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your 
attempt to destroy — ” 



Page | 550 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily 
Evans?” 

“Harry, Harry, of course I do, but — ” 

“You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?” 

Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified. 

“Be brave like my mother, Professor. ...” 

Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his 
shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment 
like an enormously overgrown baby. 

“I am not proud ...” he whispered through his fingers. 
“I am ashamed of what — of what that memory 
shows. ... I think I may have done great damage that 
day. ...” 

“You’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the 
memory,” said Harry. “It would be a very brave and 
noble thing to do.” 

Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn 
and Harry stared at each other over the guttering 
candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix 
Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait. 

Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his 
pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other 
hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty 
bottle. Still looking into Harry’s eyes, Slughorn 
touched the tip of his wand to his temple and 
withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory 
came away too, clinging to the wand tip. Longer and 
longer the memory stretched until it broke and 
swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn 
lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, 
Page | 551 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a 
trembling hand and then passed it across the table to 
Harry. 

“Thank you very much, Professor.” 

“You’re a good boy,” said Professor Slughorn, tears 
trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus 
mustache. “And you’ve got her eyes. ... Just don’t 
think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. ...” 

And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep 
sigh, and fell asleep. 



Page | 552 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






HORCRUXES 

Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he 
crept back into the castle. The front door had 
remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he 
met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by 
diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the 
time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and 
pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised 
to find her in a most unhelpful mood. 

“What sort of time do you call this?” 

“I’m really sorry — I had to go out for something 
important — ” 

“Well, the password changed at midnight, so you’ll 
just have to sleep in the corridor, won’t you?” 

“You’re joking!” said Harry. “Why did it have to 
change at midnight?” 



Page | 553 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“That’s the way it is,” said the Fat Lady. “If you’re 
angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he’s the 
one who’s tightened security.” 

“Fantastic,” said Harry bitterly, looking around at the 
hard floor. “Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take 
it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he’s 
the one who wanted me to — ” 

“He is here,” said a voice behind Harry. “Professor 
Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.” 

Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his 
head wobbling as usual upon his ruff. 

“I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,” 
said Nick. “He appeared, according to the Baron, to be 
in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.” 

“Where is he?” said Harry, his heart leaping. 

“Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy 
Tower, it’s a favorite pastime of his — ” 

“Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!” 

“Oh — in his office,” said Nick. “I believe, from what 
the Baron said, that he had business to attend to 
before turning in — ” 

“Yeah, he has,” said Harry, excitement blazing in his 
chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had 
secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted 
off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after 
him. 

“Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke 
me up! The password’s still ‘tapeworm’!” 



Page | 554 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




But Harry was already hurtling back along the 
corridor and within minutes, he was saying “toffee 
eclairs” to Dumbledore’s gargoyle, which leapt aside, 
permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. 

“Enter,” said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He 
sounded exhausted. 

Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore’s 
office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star- 
strewn skies beyond the windows. 

“Good gracious, Harry,” said Dumbledore in surprise. 
“To what do I owe this very late pleasure?” 

“Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.” 

Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to 
Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster 
looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. 

“Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done 
indeed! I knew you could do it!” 

All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently 
forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle 
with Slughorn’s memory in his uninjured hand, and 
strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve. 

“And now,” said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin 
upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle 
into it. “Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly ...” 

Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his 
feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell 
through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn’s 
office many years before. 



Page | 555 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There was the much younger Slughorn, with his 
thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond 
mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged 
armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet 
pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other 
rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And 
there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around 
Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, 
Marvolo’s gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. 

Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle 
asked, “Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is 
retiring?” 

“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said 
Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, 
though winking at the same time. “I must say, I’d like 
to know where you get your information, boy, more 
knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.” 

Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him 
admiring looks. 

“What with your uncanny ability to know things you 
shouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the people who 
matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, 
you’re quite right, it is my favorite — ” 

Several of the boys tittered again. 

“ — I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of 
Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep 
sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the 
Ministry.” 

Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed 
again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the 
eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed 
to look to him as their leader. 

Page | 556 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t know that politics would suit me, sir,” he said 
when the laughter had died away. “I don’t have the 
right kind of background, for one thing.” 

A couple of the boys around him smirked at each 
other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private 
joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or 
suspected, regarding their gang leader’s famous 
ancestor. 

“Nonsense,” said Slughorn briskly, “couldn’t be 
plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, 
abilities like yours. No, you’ll go far, Tom, I’ve never 
been wrong about a student yet.” 

The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn ’s 
desk chimed eleven o’clock behind him and he looked 
around. 

“Good gracious, is it that time already? You’d better 
get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I 
want your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same 
goes for you, Avery.” 

One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn 
heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his 
empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him 
made him look around; Riddle was still standing 
there. 

“Look sharp, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of 
bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...” 

“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.” 

“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. ...” 

“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about 
Horcruxes?” 

Page | 557 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers 
absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass. 

“Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?” 

But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well 
that this was not schoolwork. 

“Not exactly, sir,” said Riddle. “I came across the term 
while reading and I didn’t fully understand it.” 

“No ... well ... you’d be hard-pushed to find a book at 
Hogwarts that’ll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, 
that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,” said 
Slughorn. 

“But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, 
a wizard like you — sorry, I mean, if you can’t tell me, 
obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me, you 
could — so I just thought I’d ask — ” 

It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, 
the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it 
overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of 
trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people 
not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that 
Riddle wanted the information very, very much; 
perhaps had been working toward this moment for 
weeks. 

“Well,” said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but 
fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of 
crystalized pineapple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you 
an overview, of course. Just so that you understand 
the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in 
which a person has concealed part of their soul.” 

“I don’t quite understand how that works, though, 
sir,” said Riddle. 

Page | 558 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could 
sense his excitement. 

“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, 
“and hide part of it in an object outside the body. 
Then, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one 
cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound 
and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a 
form ...” 

Slughorn ’s face crumpled and Harry found himself 
remembering words he had heard nearly two years 
before: “ I was ripped from my body, I was less than 
spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was 
alive.” 

“... few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be 
preferable.” 

But Riddle’s hunger was now apparent; his 
expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his 
longing. 

“How do you split your soul?” 

“Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must 
understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact 
and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is 
against nature.” 

“But how do you do it?” 

“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By 
committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The 
wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the 
damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn 
portion — ” 

“Encase? But how — ?” 

Page | 559 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said 
Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant 
bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I have 
tried it — do I look like a killer?” 

“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry 
...I didn’t mean to offend ...” 

“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn 
gruffly. “It’s natural to feel some curiosity about these 
things. ... Wizards of a certain caliber have always 
been drawn to that aspect of magic. ...” 

“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, 
though — just out of curiosity — I mean, would one 
Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul 
once? Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to 
have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, 
isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number, 
wouldn’t seven — ?” 

“Merlin’s beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Seven! Isn’t 
it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in 
any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to 
rip it into seven pieces ...” 

Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing 
at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly 
before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting 
entering into the conversation at all. 

“Of course,” he muttered, “this is all hypothetical, 
what we’re discussing, isn’t it? All academic ...” 

“Yes, sir, of course,” said Riddle quickly. 

“But all the same, Tom ... keep it quiet, what I’ve told 
— that’s to say, what we’ve discussed. People 
wouldn’t like to think we’ve been chatting about 

Page | 560 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Horcruxes. It’s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you 
know. ... Dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it. ...” 

“I won’t say a word, sir,” said Riddle, and he left, but 
not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was 
full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he 
had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of 
happiness that did not enhance his handsome 
features, but made them, somehow, less human. ... 

“Thank you, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Let us 
go. ...” ' 

When Harry landed back on the office floor 
Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his 
desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to 
speak. 

“I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a 
very long time,” said Dumbledore at last. “It confirms 
the theory on which I have been working, it tells me 
that I am right, and also how very far there is still to 
go. ...” 

Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the 
old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits 
around the walls was awake and listening in on their 
conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had 
actually taken out an ear trumpet. 

“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “I am sure you 
understood the significance of what we just heard. At 
the same age as you are now, give or take a few 
months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out 
how to make himself immortal.” 

“You think he succeeded then, sir?” asked Harry. “He 
made a Horcrux? And that’s why he didn’t die when 



Page | 561 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden 
somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?” 

“A bit ... or more,” said Dumbledore. “You heard 
Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace 
was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard 
who created more than one Horcrux, what would 
happen to the wizard so determined to evade death 
that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip 
his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, 
separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have 
given him that information. As far as I know — as far, 
I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever 
done more than tear his soul in two.” 

Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his 
thoughts, and then said, “Four years ago, I received 
what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had 
split his soul.” 

“Where?” asked Harry “How?” 

“You handed it to me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “The 
diary, Riddle’s diary, the one giving instructions on 
how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.” 

“I don’t understand, sir,” said Harry. 

“Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out 
of the diary, what you described to me was a 
phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory 
starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, 
sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had 
fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived 
inside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost 
sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this 
raised as many questions as it answered. 



Page | 562 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that 
diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a 
safeguard.” 

“I still don’t understand,” said Harry. 

“Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — 
in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside 
it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part 
in preventing the death of its owner. But there could 
be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, 
wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess 
somebody else, so that Slytherin’s monster would be 
unleashed again.” 

“Well, he didn’t want his hard work to be wasted,” 
said Harry. “He wanted people to know he was 
Slytherin’s heir, because he couldn’t take credit at the 
time.” 

“Quite correct,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “But don’t 
you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be 
passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts 
student, he was being remarkably blase about that 
precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The 
point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn 
explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, 
not to fling it into somebody else’s path and run the 
risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: 
That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw 
to that. 

“The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this 
Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested 
that he must have made — or been planning to make 
— more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would 
not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but 
nothing else seemed to make sense. 



Page | 563 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Then you told me, two years later, that on the night 
that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most 
illuminating and alarming statement to his Death 
Eaters. % who have gone further than anybody along 
the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you 
told me he said. ‘Further than anybody,’ And I thought 
I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did 
not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in 
the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other 
wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has 
seemed to grow less human with the passing years, 
and the transformation he has undergone seemed to 
me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated 
beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’ 



“So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering 
other people?” said Harry. “Why couldn’t he make a 
Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested 
in immortality?” 

“Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years 
ago,” said Dumbledore. “But there are several reasons 
why, I think, a Sorcerer’s Stone would appeal less 
than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. 

“While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it 
must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker 
is to maintain their immortality. Therefore, Voldemort 
would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it 
ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was 
stolen, he would die just like any other man. 
Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe 
that he would have found the thought of being 
dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course 
he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of 
the horrible part-life to which he was condemned 
after attacking you, but only to regain a body. 
Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to 
Page | 564 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if 
only he could regain a human form. He was already 
immortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any 
man can be. 

“But now, Harry, armed with this information, the 
crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for 
us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord 
Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You 
heard him, Harry: ‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you 
stronger, to have your soul in more pieces ... isn’t 
seven the most powerfully magical number ...’ Isn’t 
seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I 
think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly 
appeal to Lord Voldemort.” 

“He made seven Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror- 
struck, while several of the portraits on the walls 
made similar noises of shock and outrage. “But they 
could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or 
invisible — ” 

“I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the 
problem,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But firstly, no, 
Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of 
his soul, however maimed, resides inside his 
regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived 
a spectral existence for so many years during his 
exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh 
piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to 
kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in 
his body.” 

“But the six Horcruxes, then,” said Harry, a little 
desperately, “how are we supposed to find them?” 

“You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one 
of them. And I have destroyed another.” 



Page | 565 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You have?” said Harry eagerly. 



“Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he raised his 
blackened, burned-looking hand. “The ring, Harry. 
Marvolo’s ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it 
too. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly 
modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for 
Professor Snape’s timely action when I returned to 
Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived 
to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not 
seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of 
Voldemort’s soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.” 

“But how did you find it?” 

“Well, as you now know, for many years I have made 
it my business to discover as much as I can about 
Voldemort’s past life. I have traveled widely, visiting 
those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring 
hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts’ house. It seems that 
once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of 
his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. 
He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, 
in the shack where his ancestors had once lived 
(Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), 
never guessing that I might one day take the trouble 
to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye 
open for traces of magical concealment. 

“However, we should not congratulate ourselves too 
heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if 
we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four 
Horcruxes remain.” 

“And they could be anything?” said Harry. “They 
could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion 
bottles. ...” 



Page | 566 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be 
ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord 
Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard 
his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have 
showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, 
and he preferred objects with a powerful magical 
history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, 
his determination to carve for himself a startling place 
in magical history; these things suggest to me that 
Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with 
some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.” 

“The diary wasn’t that special.” 

“The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that 
he was the Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that 
Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.” 

“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think 
you know what they are, sir?” 

“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons 
I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort 
would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a 
certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back 
through Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence 
that such artifacts have disappeared around him.” 

“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff’s cup!” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared 
to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple 
of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and 
four. The remaining two, assuming again that he 
created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will 
hazard a guess that, having secured objects from 
Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down 
objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four 
objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have 
Page | 567 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination. 

I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find 
anything of Ravenclaw’s. I am confident, however, 
that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.” 

Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall 
behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed 
within a glass case. 

“Do you think that’s why he really wanted to come 
back to Hogwarts, sir?” said Harry. “To try and find 
something from one of the other founders?” 

“My thoughts precisely,” said Dumbledore. “But 
unfortunately, that does not advance us much 
further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, 
without the chance to search the school. I am forced 
to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of 
collecting four founders’ objects. He definitely had two 
— he may have found three — that is the best we can 
do for now.” 

“Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of 
Gryffindor’s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,” said Harry, 
counting on his fingers. “Unless he got both?” 

“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore. “I think I know 
what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say 
when I confess that I have been curious for a while 
about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?” 

“The snake?” said Harry, startled. “You can use 
animals as Horcruxes?” 

“Well, it is inadvisable to do so,” said Dumbledore, 
“because to confide a part of your soul to something 
that can think and move for itself is obviously a very 
risky business. However, if my calculations are 
correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short 
Page | 568 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




of his goal of six when he entered your parents’ house 
with the intention of killing you. 



“He seems to have reserved the process of making 
Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You 
would certainly have been that. He believed that in 
killing you, he was destroying the danger the 
prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making 
himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to 
make his final Horcrux with your death. 

“As we know, he failed. After an interval of some 
years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle 
man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn 
her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the 
Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord 
Voldemort’s mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of 
her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to 
keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual 
amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.” 

“So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. 

The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, 
and you think there might be a Horcrux that was 
once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?” 

“An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,” 
said Dumbledore, bowing his head. 

“So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where 
you’ve been going when you’ve been leaving the 
school?” 

“Correct,” said Dumbledore. “I have been looking for a 
very long time. I think ... perhaps ... I may be close to 
finding another one. There are hopeful signs.” 

“And if you do,” said Harry quickly, “can I come with 
you and help get rid of it?” 

Page | 569 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a 
moment before saying, “Yes, I think so.” 

“I can?” said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. 

“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I think 
you have earned that right.” 

Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear 
words of caution and protection for once. The 
headmasters and headmistresses around the walls 
seemed less impressed by Dumbledore’s decision; 
Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and 
Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. 

“Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, 
sir? Can he feel it?” Harry asked, ignoring the 
portraits. 

“A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I 
believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, 
and these crucial parts of himself have been detached 
for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the 
point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he 
was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been 
destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius 
Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary 
had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am 
told that his anger was terrible to behold.” 

“But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it 
into Hogwarts?” 

“Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would 
be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was 
supposed to wait for Voldemort’s say-so, and he never 
received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving 
him the diary. 



Page | 570 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do 
anything with the Horcrux other than guard it 
carefully, but he was counting too much upon 
Lucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years 
and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius 
did not know what the diary really was. I understand 
that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause 
the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was 
cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a 
portion of his master’s soul in his hands, he would 
undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — 
but instead he went ahead and carried out the old 
plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon 
Arthur Weasley’s daughter, he hoped to discredit 
Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical 
object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius ... what with 
Voldemort ’s fury about the fact that he threw away 
the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the 
Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is 
not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the 
moment.” 

Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if 
all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be 
killed?” 

“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his 
Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a 
maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, 
that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, 
his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will 
take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like 
Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.” 

“But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said 
Harry, before he could stop himself. 

“Yes, you have,” said Dumbledore firmly. “You have a 
power that Voldemort has never had. You can — ” 

Page | 571 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I know!” said Harry impatiently. “I can love!” It was 
only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, 
“Big deal!” 

“Yes, Harry, you can love,” said Dumbledore, who 
looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry 
had just refrained from saying. “Which, given 
everything that has happened to you, is a great and 
remarkable thing. You are still too young to 
understand how unusual you are, Harry.” 

“So, when the prophecy says that I’ll have ‘power the 
Dark Lord knows not,’ it just means — love?” asked 
Harry, feeling a little let down. 

“Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry, never 
forget that what the prophecy says is only significant 
because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the 
end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the 
person who would be most dangerous to him — and 
in doing so, he made you the person who would be 
most dangerous to him!” 

“But it comes to the same — ” 

“No, it doesn’t!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient 
now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, 
he said, “You are setting too much store by the 
prophecy!” 

“But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy 
means — ” 

“If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would 
it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? 
Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the 
Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?” 



Page | 572 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But,” said Harry, bewildered, “but last year, you said 
one of us would have to kill the other — ” 

“Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave 
error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words! If 
Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he 
have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of 
course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for 
you, would he have given you a magical protection he 
could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you 
see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just 
as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how 
much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of 
them realize that, one day, amongst their many 
victims, there is sure to be one who rises against 
them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! 
Always he was on the lookout for the one who would 
challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt 
into action, with the result that he not only 
handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he 
handed him uniquely deadly weapons!” 

“But — ” 

“It is essential that you understand this!” said 
Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the 
room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; 
Harry had never seen him so agitated. “By attempting 
to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the 
remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and 
gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort ’s fault 
that you were able to see into his thoughts, his 
ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike 
language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, 
despite your privileged insight into Voldemort’s world 
(which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would 
kill to have), you have never been seduced by the 
Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the 



Page | 573 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




slightest desire to become one of Voldemort’s 
followers!” 

“Of course I haven’t!” said Harry indignantly. “He 
killed my mum and dad!” 

“You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” 
said Dumbledore loudly. “The only protection that can 
possibly work against the lure of power like 
Voldemort’s! In spite of all the temptation you have 
endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, 
just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when 
you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s 
desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord 
Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have 
you any idea how few wizards could have seen what 
you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have 
known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! 

“But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord 
Voldemort’s mind without damage to yourself, but he 
cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, 
as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he 
understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a 
hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to 
understand the incomparable power of a soul that is 
untarnished and whole.” 

“But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to 
sound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing, 
doesn’t it? I’ve got to try and kill him, or — ” 

“Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you’ve got to! 
But not because of the prophecy! Because you, 
yourself, will never rest until you’ve tried! We both 
know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you 
had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel 
about Voldemort now? Think!” 



Page | 574 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in 
front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, 
his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. 
He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord 
Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside 
his chest, searing his throat. 

“I’d want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I’d 
want to do it.” 

“Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, 
the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! 
But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you 
as his equal. ... In other words, you are free to choose 
your way, quite free to turn your back on the 
prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the 
prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which 
makes it certain, really, that — ” 

“That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” 
said Harry. “Yes.” 

But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been 
trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference 
between being dragged into the arena to face a battle 
to the death and walking into the arena with your 
head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that 
there was little to choose between the two ways, but 
Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with 
a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that 
there was all the difference in the world.

SECTUMSEMPRA 

Exhausted but delighted with his night’s work, Harry 
told Ron and Hermione everything that had happened 
during next morning’s Charms lesson (having first 
cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them). 
They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he 
had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and 
positively awed when he told them about Voldemort’s 
Horcruxes and Dumbledore’s promise to take Harry 
along, should he find another one. 

“Wow,” said Ron, when Harry had finally finished 
telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand 
very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without 
paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was 
doing. “Wow. You’re actually going to go with 
Dumbledore ... and try and destroy ... wow.” 

“Ron, you’re making it snow,” said Hermione 
patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand 
away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large 
white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, 



Page | 576 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring 
table through very red eyes, and Hermione 
immediately let go of Ron’s arm. 

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in 
vague surprise. “Sorry ... looks like we’ve all got 
horrible dandruff now. ...” 

He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione ’s 
shoulder. Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked 
immensely guilty and turned his back on her. 

“We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his 
mouth. “Last night. When she saw me coming out of 
the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn’t 
see you, so she thought it had just been the two of 
us.” 



“Ah,” said Harry. “Well — you don’t mind it’s over, do 
you?” 

“No,” Ron admitted. “It was pretty bad while she was 
yelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish it.” 

“Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. 
“Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. 
Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.” 

Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her 
eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly 
know that his insides were suddenly dancing the 
conga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as 
indifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?” 

“Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always 
trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she 
couldn’t climb in herself ... but they’ve been a bit 
rocky for ages.” 



Page | 577 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the 
classroom. He certainly looked unhappy. 

“Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, 
doesn’t it?” said Hermione. 

“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. 

“The Quidditch team,” said Hermione. “If Ginny and 
Dean aren’t speaking ...” 

“Oh — oh yeah,” said Harry. 

“Flitwick,” said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little 
Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, 
and Hermione was the only one who had managed to 
turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep 
crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry’s and 
Ron’s were still murky brown. 

“Now, now, boys,” squeaked Professor Flitwick 
reproachfully. “A little less talk, a little more action ... 
Let me see you try. ...” 

Together they raised their wands, concentrating with 
all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. 
Harry’s vinegar turned to ice; Ron’s flask exploded. 

“Yes ... for homework,” said Professor Flitwick, 
reemerging from under the table and pulling shards 
of glass out of the top of his hat, “practice.” 

They had one of their rare joint free periods after 
Charms and walked back to the common room 
together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted 
about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and 
Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked 
what she was grinning about she simply said, “It’s a 



Page | 578 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




nice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed 
that a fierce battle was raging inside Harry’s brain: 

She’s Ron’s sister. 

But she’s ditched Dean! 

She’s still Ron’s sister. 

I’m his best mate! 

That’ll make it worse. 

If I talked to him first — 

He’d hit you. 

What if I don’t care? 

He’s your best mate\ 

Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through 
the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and 
only vaguely registered the small group of seventh 
years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, 
“Katie! You’re back! Are you okay?” 

Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking 
completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant 
friends. 

“I’m really well!” she said happily. “They let me out of 
St. Mungo’s on Monday, I had a couple of days at 
home with Mum and Dad and then came back here 
this morning. Leanne was just telling me about 
McLaggen and the last match, Harry. ...” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “well, now you’re back and Ron’s 
fit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing 

Page | 579 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the 
running for the Cup. Listen, Katie ...” 

He had to put the question to her at once; his 
curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his 
brain. He dropped his voice as Katie’s friends started 
gathering up their things; apparently they were late 
for Transfiguration. 

"... that necklace ... can you remember who gave it to 
you now?” 

“No,” said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. 
“Everyone’s been asking me, but I haven’t got a clue. 
The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies’ 
in the Three Broomsticks.” 

“You definitely went into the bathroom, then?” said 
Hermione. 

“Well, I know I pushed open the door,” said Katie, “so 
I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just 
behind it. After that, my memory’s a blank until 
about two weeks ago in St. Mungo’s. Listen, I’d better 
go, I wouldn’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines 
even if it is my first day back. ...” 

She caught up her bag and books and hurried after 
her friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit 
down at a window table and ponder what she had told 
them. 

“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave 
Katie the necklace,” said Hermione, “to be in the 
ladies’ bathroom.” 

“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said 
Harry. “Don’t forget, there was a cauldron full of 



Page | 580 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got 
stolen. ...” 

In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes 
and Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls. 

“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said 
Harry, “and have a go at the Room of Requirement 
again.” 

“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said 
Hermione flatly, putting down the copy of Spellman’s 
Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. “Luck 
can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with 
Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to 
persuade him, you just needed to tweak the 
circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you 
through a powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go 
wasting the rest of that potion! You’ll need all the luck 
you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him 
...” She dropped her voice to a whisper. 

“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, 
ignoring Hermione. “It’d be great to have a stock of it. 
... Have a look in the book ...” 

Harry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out 
of his bag and looked up Felix Felicis. 

“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running 
an eye down the list of ingredients. “And it takes six 
months ... You’ve got to let it stew. ...” 

“Typical,” said Ron. 

Harry was about to put his book away again when he 
noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to 
it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned “For 
Enemies,” that he had marked a few weeks 

Page | 581 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




previously. He had still not found out what it did, 
mainly because he did not want to test it around 
Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on 
McLaggen next time he came up behind him 
unawares. 

The only person who was not particularly pleased to 
see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, 
because he would no longer be required to fill her 
place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough 
when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, 
but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away 
that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously 
behind his back. 

The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch 
practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was 
so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have 
Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely 
well. 

Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup 
with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul 
of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing 
up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle 
sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at 
McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them 
all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, 
was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; 
he had received several more Bludger injuries during 
practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on 
the Snitch. 

The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? 
Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron 
might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but 
then he remembered Ron’s expression when he had 
seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would 



Page | 582 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held 
her hand. ... 

Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, 
laughing with her, walking back from practice with 
her; however much his conscience ached, he found 
himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It 
would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another 
of his little parties, for Ron would not be around — 
but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given 
them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for 
Hermione’s help, but he did not think he could stand 
seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he 
caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him 
staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to 
complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if 
he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny 
out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact 
that she was too popular for her own good. 

All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix 
Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely 
this was a case for, as Hermione put it, “tweaking the 
circumstances”? The balmy days slid gently through 
May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry’s shoulder 
every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing 
for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to 
realize that nothing would make him happier than his 
best friend and his sister falling for each other and to 
leave them alone together for longer than a few 
seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the 
final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron 
wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had 
little thought for anything else. 

Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the 
Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely 
high throughout the school, for the match would 
decide the Championship, which was still wide open. 

Page | 583 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three 
hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never 
known his team to fly better) then they would win the 
Championship. If they won by less than three 
hundred points, they would come second to 
Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they 
would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by 
more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place 
and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him 
forget that it had been he who had captained 
Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in 
two centuries. 

The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual 
features: members of rival Houses attempting to 
intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; 
unpleasant chants about individual players being 
rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members 
themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the 
attention or else dashing into bathrooms between 
classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become 
inextricably linked in Harry’s mind with success or 
failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help 
feeling that if they won by more than three hundred 
points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after- 
match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of 
Felix Felicis. 

In the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not 
forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy 
was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still 
checking the Marauder’s Map, and as he was unable 
to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still 
spending plenty of time within the room. Although 
Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in 
getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted 
it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how 
he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly 
doorless. 

Page | 584 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, 

Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone 
from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a 
nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and 
Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector 
about a mistake she thought she might have made in 
her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than 
anything, Harry made his usual detour along the 
seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder’s Map 
as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy 
anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the 
Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy’s 
tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the 
floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, 
but by Moaning Myrtle. 

Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling 
when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud 
crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from 
the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the 
marble staircase and along the passageway below. 
Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the 
door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly 
pushed the door open. 

Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, 
his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white- 
blond head bowed. 

“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of 
the cubicles. “Don’t ... tell me what’s wrong ... I can 
help you. ...” 

“No one can help me,” said Malfoy. His whole body 
was shaking. “I can’t do it. ... I can’t. ... It won’t work 
... and unless I do it soon ... he says he’ll kill me. ...” 

And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to 
root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying — 

Page | 585 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




actually crying — tears streaming down his pale face 
into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and 
then, with a great shudder, looked up into the 
cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his 
shoulder. 

Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. 
Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy’s hex 
missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the 
wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, 
thought Levicorpus\ and flicked his wand, but Malfoy 
blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another — 

“No! No! Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice 
echoing loudly around the tiled room. “Stop! STOP!” 

There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry 
exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that 
backfired off the wall behind Malfoy’s ear and 
smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who 
screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry 
slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, “Cruci — ” 

“ SECTUMSEMPRAl” bellowed Harry from the floor, 
waving his wand wildly. 

Blood spurted from Malfoy’s face and chest as though 
he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He 
staggered backward and collapsed onto the 
waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling 
from his limp right hand. 

“No — ” gasped Harry. 

Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and 
plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining 
scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood- 
soaked chest. 



Page | 586 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No — I didn’t — ” 



Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his 
knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably 
in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a 
deafening scream: “MURDER! MURDER IN THE 
BATHROOM! MURDER!” 

The door banged open behind Harry and he looked 
up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face 
livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over 
Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep 
wounds Harry’s curse had made, muttering an 
incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow 
of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue 
from Malfoy’s face and repeated his spell. Now the 
wounds seemed to be knitting. 

Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had 
done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood 
and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and 
wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his 
countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy 
into a standing position. 

“You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain 
amount of scarring, but if you take dittany 
immediately we might avoid even that. ... Come. ...” 

He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at 
the door to say in a voice of cold fury, “And you, 

Potter ... You wait here for me.” 

It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He 
stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet 
floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson 
flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in 
himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she 



Page | 587 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident 
enjoyment. 



Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the 
bathroom and closed the door behind him. 

“Go,” he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into 
her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind 
her. 

“I didn’t mean it to happen,” said Harry at once. His 
voice echoed in the cold, watery space. “I didn’t know 
what that spell did.” 

But Snape ignored this. “Apparently I underestimated 
you, Potter,” he said quietly. “Who would have 
thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you 
that spell?” 

“I — read about it somewhere.” 

“Where?” 

“It was — a library book,” Harry invented wildly. “I 
can’t remember what it was call — ” 

“Liar,” said Snape. Harry’s throat went dry. He knew 
what Snape was going to do and he had never been 
able to prevent it. ... 

The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he 
struggled to block out all thought, but try as he 
might, the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced 
Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of his 
mind. 

And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst 
of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into 



Page | 588 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Snape’s black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape 
had not seen what he feared, but — 

“Bring me your schoolbag,” said Snape softly, “and all 
of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me 
here. Now!” 

There was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and 
splashed out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, 
he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower. Most 
people were walking the other way; they gaped at him, 
drenched in water and blood, but he answered none 
of the questions fired at him as he ran past. 

He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had 
turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been 
thinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what 
would happen when Snape saw it? Would he tell 
Slughorn — Harry’s stomach churned — how Harry 
had been achieving such good results in Potions all 
year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that 
had taught Harry so much . . . the book that had 
become a kind of guide and friend? Harry could not 
let it happen. ... He could not ... 

“Where Ve you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that 
blood?” 

Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking 
bewildered at the sight of Harry. 

“I need your book,” Harry panted. “Your Potions book. 
Quick ... give it to me ...” 

“But what about the Half-Blood — ” 

“I’ll explain later!” 



Page | 589 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of 
his bag and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past 
him and back to the common room. Here, he seized 
his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several 
people who had already finished their dinner, threw 
himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off 
along the seventh-floor corridor. 

He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing 
trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk. 

I need a place to hide my book. ... I need a place to 
hide my book. ... I need a place to hide my book. . . . 

Three times he walked up and down in front of the 
stretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there 
it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. 
Harry wrenched it open, flung himself inside, and 
slammed it shut. 

He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of 
what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not 
help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He 
was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, 
whose high windows were sending shafts of light 
down upon what looked like a city with towering 
walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects 
hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There 
were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles 
of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, 
perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or 
else hidden by castle-proud house-elves. There were 
thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned 
or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults 
and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in 
them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of 
other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of 
congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were 
what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles 
Page | 590 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting 
swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe. 

Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways 
between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past 
an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a 
left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which 
Montague had got lost the previous year, finally 
pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have 
had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened 
one of the cupboard’s creaking doors: It had already 
been used as a hiding place for something in a cage 
that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He 
stuffed the Half-Blood Prince’s book behind the cage 
and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his 
heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the 
clutter. ... Would he be able to find this spot again 
amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an 
ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he 
stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was 
now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished 
tiara on the statue’s head to make it more distinctive, 
then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden 
junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back 
out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door 
behind him, and it turned at once back into stone. 

Harry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor 
below, cramming Ron’s copy of Advanced Potion- 
Making into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he 
was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand 
wordlessly for Harry’s schoolbag. Harry handed it 
over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited. 

One by one, Snape extracted Harry’s books and 
examined them. Finally, the only book left was the 
Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before 
speaking. 



Page | 591 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, 
Potter?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, still breathing hard. 

“You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, with a touch more defiance. 

“This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you 
purchased from Flourish and Blotts?” 

“Yes,” said Harry firmly. 

“Then why,” asked Snape, “does it have the name 
‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?” 

Harry’s heart missed a beat. “That’s my nickname,” 
he said. 

“Your nickname,” repeated Snape. 

“Yeah ... that’s what my friends call me,” said Harry. 

“I understand what a nickname is,” said Snape. The 
cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harry’s; 
he tried not to look into them. Close your mind. ... 
Close your mind. . . . But he had never learned how to 
do it properly. . . . 

“Do you know what I think, Potter?” said Snape, very 
quietly. “I think that you are a liar and a cheat and 
that you deserve detention with me every Saturday 
until the end of term. What do you think, Potter?” 

“I — I don’t agree, sir,” said Harry, still refusing to 
look into Snape ’s eyes. 



Page | 592 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, we shall see how you feel after your 
detentions,” said Snape. “Ten o’clock Saturday 
morning, Potter. My office.” 

“But sir ...” said Harry, looking up desperately. 
“Quidditch ... the last match of the ...” 

“Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that 
showed his yellow teeth. “Poor Gryffindor ... fourth 
place this year, I fear ...” 

And he left the bathroom without another word, 
leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling 
sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life. 

“I won’t say ‘I told you so,’ ” said Hermione, an hour 
later in the common room. 

“Leave it, Hermione,” said Ron angrily. 

Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite 
at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and 
Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to 
have been much need. The news had traveled very 
fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon 
herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to 
tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the 
hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no 
time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had 
told the staff precisely what had happened. Harry had 
already been called out of the common room to 
endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the 
company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him 
he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she 
supported wholeheartedly Snape ’s punishment of 
detention every Saturday until the end of term.

“I told you there was something wrong with that 
Prince person,” Hermione said, evidently unable to 
stop herself. “And I was right, wasn’t I?” 

“No, I don’t think you were,” said Harry stubbornly. 

He was having a bad enough time without Hermione 
lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team’s 
faces when he had told them he would not be able to 
play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of 
all. He could feel Ginny’s eyes on him now but did not 
meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or 
anger there. He had just told her that she would be 
playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be 
rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if 
they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the 
post-match euphoria. ... The thought went through 
Harry like an icy knife. ... 

“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up 
for that book when that spell — ” 

“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped 
Harry. “The Prince only copied it out! It’s not like he 
was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he 
was making a note of something that had been used 
against him!” 

“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually 
defending — ” 

“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I 
wish I hadn’t done it, and not just because I’ve got 
about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn’t’ve 
used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you 
can’t blame the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, 
it’s really good’ — he was just making notes for 
himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. ...” 



Page | 594 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re 
going to go back — ?” 

“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. 
“Listen, without the Prince I’d never have won the 
Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to save Ron 
from poisoning, I’d never have — ” 

“ — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t 
deserve,” said Hermione nastily. 

“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was 
so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. “By the sound 
of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, 
you should be glad Harry had something good up his 
sleeve!” 

“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said 
Hermione, clearly stung. “But you can’t call that 
Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it’s 
landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing what this 
has done to your chances in the match — ” 

“Oh, don’t start acting as though you understand 
Quidditch,” snapped Ginny, “you’ll only embarrass 
yourself.” 

Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had 
always got on together very well, were now sitting 
with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. 
Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a 
book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, 
little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably 
cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them 
spoke again for the rest of the evening. 

His lightheartedness was short-lived. There were 
Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to 
mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who 

Page | 595 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




were most unhappy that their Captain had got 
himself banned from the final match of the season. By 
Saturday morning, whatever he might have told 
Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the 
Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the 
Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It 
was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of 
students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them 
wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners 
and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the 
dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the 
crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would 
not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer 
or groan. 

“Ah, Potter,” said Snape, when Harry had knocked on 
his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office 
that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had 
not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same 
slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions 
all around the walls. Ominously, there were many 
cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was 
clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, 
hard, and pointless work about them. 

“Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out 
these old files,” said Snape softly. “They are the 
records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their 
punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the 
cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like 
you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh 
and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, 
replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.” 

“Right, Professor,” said Harry, with as much contempt 
as he could put into the last three syllables. 

“I thought you could start,” said Snape, a malicious 
smile on his lips, “with boxes one thousand and 

Page | 596 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find 
some familiar names in there, which should add 
interest to the task. Here, you see ...” 

He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes 
with a flourish and read, “ ‘James Potter and Sirius 
Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram 
Aubrey. Aubrey’s head twice normal size. Double 
detention.’ ” Snape sneered. “It must be such a 
comfort to think that, though they are gone, a record 
of their great achievements remains. ...” 

Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of 
his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself 
retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and 
pulled one toward him. 

It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring 
work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with 
the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just 
read his father or Sirius’s names, usually coupled 
together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally 
accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter 
Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various 
offenses and punishments, he wondered what was 
going on outside, where the match would have just 
started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . . 

Harry glanced again and again at the large clock 
ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as 
fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched 
it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for 
only half an hour ... an hour ... an hour and a half. . . . 

Harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock 
showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken 
at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at 
ten past one. 



Page | 597 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I think that will do,” he said coldly. “Mark the place 
you have reached. You will continue at ten o’clock 
next Saturday.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and 
hurried out of the door before Snape could change his 
mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his 
ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. 
...It was over, then. ... 

He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran 
up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won 
or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated 
in their own common room. 

“ Quid agis?” he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, 
wondering what he would find inside. 

Her expression was unreadable as she replied, “You’ll 
see.” 

And she swung forward. 

A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind 
her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the 
sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room. 

“We won!” yelled Ron, bounding into sight and 
brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. “We won! Four 
hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!” 

Harry looked around; there was Ginny running 
toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face 
as she threw her arms around him. And without 
thinking, without planning it, without worrying about 
the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed 
her. 

Page | 598 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




After several long moments — or it might have been 
half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they 
broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then 
several people wolf-whistled and there was an 
outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the 
top of Ginny’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a 
shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane 
looking as though she might throw something. 
Hermione was beaming, but Harry’s eyes sought Ron. 
At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and 
wearing an expression appropriate to having been 
clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they 
looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the 
head that Harry understood to mean, Well — if you 
must. 

The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he 
grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of 
the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed 
indicated, during which — if they had time — they 
might discuss the match. 



Page | 599 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






THE SEER OVERHEARD 

The fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny 
Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, 
most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and 
happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. 
After all, it made a very nice change to be talked 
about because of something that was making him 
happier than he could remember being for a very long 
time, rather than because he had been involved in 
horrific scenes of Dark Magic. 

“You’d think people had better things to gossip 
about,” said Ginny, as she sat on the common room 
floor, leaning against Harry’s legs and reading the 
Daily Prophet “Three dementor attacks in a week, and 
all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got 
a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.” 

Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry 
ignored them. 

“What did you tell her?” 



Page | 600 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“I told her it’s a Hungarian Horntail,” said Ginny, 
turning a page of the newspaper idly. “Much more 
macho.” 



“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning. “And what did you tell 
her Ron’s got?” 

“A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.” 

Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing. 

“Watch it,” he said, pointing warningly at Harry and 
Ginny. “Just because I’ve given my permission doesn’t 
mean I can’t withdraw it — ” 

“ ‘Your permission,’ ” scoffed Ginny. “Since when did 
you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you 
said yourself you’d rather it was Harry than Michael 
or Dean.” 

“Yeah, I would,” said Ron grudgingly. “And just as 
long as you don’t start snogging each other in public 



“You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, 
thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the 
place?” demanded Ginny. 

But Ron’s tolerance was not to be tested much as 
they moved into June, for Harry and Ginny’s time 
together was becoming increasingly restricted. 

Ginny’s O.W.L.s were approaching and she was 
therefore forced to study for hours into the night. On 
one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the 
library, and Harry was sitting beside the window in 
the common room, supposedly finishing his 
Herbology homework but in reality reliving a 
particularly happy hour he had spent down by the 
lake with Ginny at lunchtime, Hermione dropped into 
Page | 601 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly 
purposeful look on her face. 

“I want to talk to you, Harry.” 

“What about?” said Harry suspiciously. Only the 
previous day, Hermione had told him off for 
distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard 
for her examinations. 

“The so-called Half-Blood Prince.” 

“Oh, not again,” he groaned. “Will you please drop it?” 

He had not dared to return to the Room of 
Requirement to retrieve his book, and his 
performance in Potions was suffering accordingly 
(though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had 
jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But 
Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope 
of laying hands on the Prince’s book, and was 
determined to leave it where it was while Snape 
remained on the lookout. 

“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until 
you’ve heard me out. Now, I’ve been trying to find out 
a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing 
Dark spells — ” 

“He didn’t make a hobby of it — ” 

“He, he — who says it’s a he?” 

“We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly. “Prince, 
Hermione, PrinceV’ 

“Right!” said Hermione, red patches blazing in her 
cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out 



Page | 602 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in 
front of Harry. “Look at that! Look at the picture!” 



Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and 
stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; 
Ron leaned over for a look too. The picture showed a 
skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she 
looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy 
brows and a long, pallid face. Underneath the 
photograph was the caption: EILEEN PRINCE, 
CAPTAIN OF THE HOGWARTS GOBSTONES TEAM. 

“So?” said Harry, scanning the short news item to 
which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story 
about interschool competitions. 

“Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.” 

They looked at each other, and Harry realized what 
Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing. 

“No way.” 

“What?” 

“You think she was the Half-Blood ... ? Oh, come on.” 

“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in 
the Wizarding world! It’s either a nickname, a made- 
up title somebody’s given themselves, or it could be 
their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her 
father was a wizard whose surname was Prince, and 
her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her 
a “half-blood Prince’!” 

“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione ...” 

“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a 
Prince!” 

Page | 603 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just 
tell.” 



“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have 
been clever enough,” said Hermione angrily. 

“How can I have hung round with you for five years 
and not think girls are clever?” said Harry, stung by 
this. “It’s the way he writes, I just know the Prince 
was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to 
do with it. Where did you get this anyway?” 

“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a 
whole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, I’m 
going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.” 

“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably. 

“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” 
she shot at him, as she reached the portrait hole, “is 
records of old Potions awards!” 

Harry scowled after her for a moment, then continued 
his contemplation of the darkening sky. 

“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in 
Potions,” said Ron, returning to his copy of A 
Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. 

“You don’t think I’m mad, wanting that book back, do 
you?” 

“ ’Course not,” said Ron robustly. “He was a genius, 
the Prince. Anyway ... without his bezoar tip ...” He 
drew his finger significantly across his own throat. “I 
wouldn’t be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, I’m 
not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great — ” 

“Nor am I,” said Harry quickly. 

Page | 604 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in 
no time.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry; this was perfectly true, although 
his conscience squirmed slightly all the same. 

“Thanks to Snape ...” 

“You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?” 
Ron continued. 

“Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday 
after that,” sighed Harry. “And he’s hinting now that if 
I don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we’ll 
carry on next year.” 

He was finding these detentions particularly irksome 
because they cut into the already limited time he 
could have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had 
frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not 
know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later 
every time, while making pointed asides about Harry 
having to miss the good weather and the varied 
opportunities it offered. 

Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the 
appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was 
holding out a scroll of parchment. 

“Thanks, Jimmy ... Hey, it’s from Dumbledore!” said 
Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and 
scanning it. “He wants me to go to his office as quick 
as I can!” 

They stared at each other. 

“Blimey,” whispered Ron. “You don’t reckon ... he 
hasn’t found ... ?” 



Page | 605 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said Harry, jumping to 
his feet. 

He hurried out of the common room and along the 
seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but 
Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, 
throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of 
way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry’s 
defensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was 
silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left 
until curfew, most people had already returned to 
their common rooms. 

And then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He 
stopped in his tracks, listening. 

“How — dare — you — aaaaargh!” 

The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry 
sprinted toward it, his wand at the ready, hurtled 
around another corner, and saw Professor Trelawney 
sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of 
her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside 
her, one broken. 

“Professor — ” 

Harry hurried forward and helped Professor 
Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads 
had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccuped 
loudly, patted her hair, and pulled herself up on 
Harry’s helping arm. 

“What happened, Professor?” 

“You may well ask!” she said shrilly. “I was strolling 
along, brooding upon certain dark portents I happen 
to have glimpsed ...” 



Page | 606 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




But Harry was not paying much attention. He had 
just noticed where they were standing: There on the 
right was the tapestry of dancing trolls, and on the 
left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall 
that concealed — 

“Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of 
Requirement?” 

"... omens I have been vouchsafed — what?” She 
looked suddenly shifty. 

“The Room of Requirement,” repeated Harry. “Were 
you trying to get in there?” 

“I — well — I didn’t know students knew about — ” 

“Not all of them do,” said Harry. “But what happened? 
You screamed. ... It sounded as though you were 
hurt. ...” 

“I — well,” said Professor Trelawney, drawing her 
shawls around her defensively and staring down at 
him with her vastly magnified eyes. “I wished to — ah 
— deposit certain — um — personal items in the 
room. ...” And she muttered something about “nasty 
accusations.” 

“Right,” said Harry, glancing down at the sherry 
bottles. “But you couldn’t get in and hide them?” 

He found this very odd; the room had opened for him, 
after all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood 
Prince’s book. 

“Oh, I got in all right,” said Professor Trelawney, 
glaring at the wall. “But there was somebody already 
in there.” 



Page | 607 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Somebody in — ? Who?” demanded Harry. “Who was 
in there?” 

“I have no idea,” said Professor Trelawney, looking 
slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry’s voice. “I 
walked into the room and I heard a voice, which has 
never happened before in all my years of hiding — of 
using the room, I mean.” 

“A voice? Saying what?” 

“I don’t know that it was saying anything,” said 
Professor Trelawney. “It was ... whooping.” 

“ Whooping?” 

“Gleefully,” she said, nodding. 

Harry stared at her. 

“Was it male or female?” 

“I would hazard a guess at male,” said Professor 
Trelawney. 

“And it sounded happy?” 

“Very happy,” said Professor Trelawney sniffily. 

“As though it was celebrating?” 

“Most definitely.” 

“And then — ?” 

“And then I called out Who’s there?’ ” 

“You couldn’t have found out who it was without 
asking?” Harry asked her, slightly frustrated. 

Page | 608 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“The Inner Eye,” said Professor Trelawney with 
dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of 
glittering beads, “was fixed upon matters well outside 
the mundane realms of whooping voices.” 

“Right,” said Harry hastily; he had heard about 
Professor Trelawney’s Inner Eye all too often before. 
“And did the voice say who was there?” 

“No, it did not,” she said. “Everything went pitch- 
black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled 
headfirst out of the room!” 

“And you didn’t see that coming?” said Harry, unable 
to help himself. 

“No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch — ” She stopped 
and glared at him suspiciously. 

“I think you’d better tell Professor Dumbledore,” said 
Harry. “He ought to know Malfoy’s celebrating — I 
mean, that someone threw you out of the room.” 

To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up 
at this suggestion, looking haughty. 

“The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer 
fewer visits from me,” she said coldly. “I am not one to 
press my company upon those who do not value it. If 
Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards 
show — ” Her bony hand closed suddenly around 
Harry’s wrist. “Again and again, no matter how I lay 
them out — ” And she pulled a card dramatically from 
underneath her shawls. “ — the lightning-struck 
tower,” she whispered. “Calamity. Disaster. Coming 
nearer all the time ...” 

“Right,” said Harry again. “Well ... I still think you 
should tell Dumbledore about this voice, and 

Page | 609 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




everything going dark and being thrown out of the 
room. ...” 

“You think so?” Professor Trelawney seemed to 
consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could 
tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little 
adventure. 

“I’m going to see him right now,” said Harry. “I’ve got 
a meeting with him. We could go together.” 

“Oh, well, in that case,” said Professor Trelawney with 
a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry 
bottles, and dumped them unceremoniously in a large 
blue-and-white vase standing in a nearby niche. 

“I miss having you in my classes, Harry,” she said 
soulfully as they set off together. “You were never 
much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object 



Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object 
of Professor Trelawney’s continual predictions of 
doom. 

“I am afraid,” she went on, “that the nag — I’m sorry, 
the centaur — knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked 
him — one Seer to another — had he not, too, sensed 
the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he 
seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!” 

Her voice rose rather hysterically, and Harry caught a 
powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had 
been left behind. 

“Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have 
not inherited my great-great-grandmother’s gift. 

Those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous 
for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? 

Page | 610 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great 
school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I 
not proved myself to him?” 

Harry mumbled something indistinct. 

“I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,” 
went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. “He 
was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed. ... 
I was staying at the Hog’s Head, which I do not 
advise, incidentally — bedbugs, dear boy — but funds 
were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling 
upon me in my room. He questioned me. ... I must 
confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed 
toward Divination . . . and I remember I was starting to 
feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but 
then ...” 

And now Harry was paying attention properly for the 
first time, for he knew what had happened then: 
Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had 
altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy 
about him and Voldemort. 

"... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus 
Snape!” 

“What?” 

“Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it 
flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman 
standing with Snape, who was waffling about having 
come the wrong way up the stairs, although I’m afraid 
that I myself rather thought he had been 
apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with 
Dumbledore — you see, he himself was seeking a job 
at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, 
after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more 
disposed to give me a job, and I could not help 
Page | 611 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated 
the stark contrast between my own unassuming 
manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, 
thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at 
keyholes — Harry, dear?” 

She looked back over her shoulder, having only just 
realized that Harry was no longer with her; he had 
stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each 
other. 

“Harry?” she repeated uncertainly. 

Perhaps his face was white to make her look so 
concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock- 
still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after 
wave, obliterating everything except the information 
that had been kept from him for so long. . . . 

It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was 
Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to 
Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had 
sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and 
their son. ... 

Nothing else mattered to Harry just now. 

“Harry?” said Professor Trelawney again. “Harry — I 
thought we were going to see the headmaster 
together?” 

“You stay here,” said Harry through numb lips. 

“But dear ... I was going to tell him how I was 
assaulted in the Room of — ” 

“You stay here!” Harry repeated angrily. 



Page | 612 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She looked alarmed as he ran past her, around the 
corner into Dumbledore’s corridor, where the lone 
gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at 
the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase 
three steps at a time. He did not knock upon 
Dumbledore’s door, he hammered; and the calm voice 
answered, “Enter” after Harry had already flung 
himself into the room. 

Fawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black 
eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset 
beyond the windows. Dumbledore was standing at the 
window looking out at the grounds, a long, black 
traveling cloak in his arms. 

“Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with 
me.” 

For a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the 
conversation with Trelawney had driven everything 
else out of his head and his brain seemed to be 
moving very slowly. 

“Come . . . with you ... ?” 

“Only if you wish it, of course.” 

“If I ...” 

And then Harry remembered why he had been eager 
to come to Dumbledore’s office in the first place. 
“You’ve found one? You’ve found a Horcrux?” 

“I believe so.” 

Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: 
For several moments, Harry could not speak. 

“It is natural to be afraid,” said Dumbledore. 

Page | 613 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm not scared!” said Harry at once, and it was 
perfectly true; fear was one emotion he was not 
feeling at all. “Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?” 

“I am not sure which it is — though I think we can 
rule out the snake — but I believe it to be hidden in a 
cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have 
been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in 
which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from 
his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. “How is it protected?” 

“I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely 
wrong.” Dumbledore hesitated, then said, “Harry, I 
promised you that you could come with me, and I 
stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of 
me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly 
dangerous.” 

“I’m coming,” said Harry, almost before Dumbledore 
had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, 
his desire to do something desperate and risky had 
increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This 
seemed to show on Harry’s face, for Dumbledore 
moved away from the window and looked more closely 
at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows. 

“What has happened to you?” 

“Nothing,” lied Harry promptly. 

“What has upset you?” 

“I’m not upset.” 

“Harry, you were never a good Occlumens — ” 



The word was the spark that ignited Harry’s fury. 

Page | 614 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Snape!” he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft 
squawk behind them. “Snape’s what’s happened! He 
told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he 
listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!” 

Dumbledore’s expression did not change, but Harry 
thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast 
by the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore 
said nothing. “When did you find out about this?” he 
asked at last. 

“Just now!” said Harry, who was refraining from 
yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, 
he could not stop himself. “AND YOU LET HIM 
TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO 
AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!” 

Breathing hard as though he was fighting, Harry 
turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not 
moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, 
rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising 
every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking 
things over. He wanted to rage and storm at 
Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try 
and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that 
he was a foolish old man for trusting Snape, but he 
was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him 
along unless he mastered his anger. ... 

“Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Please listen to 
me.” 

It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to 
refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, 
and looked into Dumbledore’s lined face. 

“Professor Snape made a terrible — ” 



Page | 615 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening 
at the door!” 

“Please let me finish.” Dumbledore waited until Harry 
had nodded curtly, then went on. “Professor Snape 
made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord 
Voldemort’s employ on the night he heard the first 
half of Professor Trelawney’s prophecy. Naturally, he 
hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it 
concerned his master most deeply. But he did not 
know — he had no possible way of knowing — which 
boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward, or that 
the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest 
were people that Professor Snape knew, that they 
were your mother and father — ” 

Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter. 

“He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven’t you 
noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend 
to end up dead?” 

“You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt 
when he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted 
the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest 
regret of his life and the reason that he returned — ” 

“But he’s a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir?” said 
Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of 
keeping it steady. “And isn’t Voldemort convinced that 
Snape’s on his side, even now? Professor ... how can 
you be sure Snape’s on our side?” 

Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as 
though he was trying to make up his mind about 
something. At last he said, “I am sure. I trust Severus 
Snape completely.” 



Page | 616 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort 
to steady himself. It did not work. 

“Well, I don’t!” he said, as loudly as before. “He’s up to 
something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under 
your nose, and you still — ” 

“We have discussed this, Harry,” said Dumbledore, 
and now he sounded stern again. “I have told you my 
views.” 

“You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you 
haven’t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might 
decide to — ” 

“To what?” asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. 
“What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?” 

“I ... they’re up to something!” said Harry, and his 
hands curled into fists as he said it. “Professor 
Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, 
trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard 
Malfoy whooping, celebrating! He’s trying to mend 
something dangerous in there and if you ask me, he’s 
fixed it at last and you’re about to just walk out of 
school without — ” 

“Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, 
and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had 
finally crossed some invisible line. “Do you think that 
I have once left the school unprotected during my 
absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, 
there will again be additional protection in place. 
Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of 
my students seriously, Harry.” 

“I didn’t — ” mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but 
Dumbledore cut across him. 



Page | 617 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.” 

Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too 
far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying 
Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, “Do you wish 
to come with me tonight?” 

“Yes,” said Harry at once. 

“Very well, then: Listen.” Dumbledore drew himself up 
to his full height. “I take you with me on one 
condition: that you obey any command I might give 
you at once, and without question.” 

“Of course.” 

“Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you 
must follow even such orders as ‘run,’ ‘hide,’ or ‘go 
back.’ Do I have your word?” 

“I — yes, of course.” 

“If I tell you to hide, you will do so?” 

“Yes.” 

“If I tell you to flee, you will obey?” 

“Yes.” 

“If I tell you to leave me and save yourself, you will do 
as I tell you? 



“Harry?” 

They looked at each other for a moment. 



Page | 618 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, sir.” 



“Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your 
Invisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in 
five minutes’ time.” 

Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery 
window; the sun was now a ruby red glare along the 
horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and 
down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear 
all of a sudden. He knew what to do. 

Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the 
common room when he came back. “What does he 
want?” Hermione said at once. “Harry, are you okay?” 
she added anxiously. 

“I’m fine,” said Harry shortly, racing past them. He 
dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he 
flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder’s 
Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back 
down the stairs and into the common room, skidding 
to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking 
stunned. 

“I’ve got to be quick,” Harry panted. “Dumbledore 
thinks I’m getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen. ...” 

Quickly he told them where he was going and why. He 
did not pause either for Hermione ’s gasps of horror or 
for Ron’s hasty questions; they could work out the 
finer details for themselves later. 

“... so you see what this means?” Harry finished at a 
gallop. “Dumbledore won’t be here tonight, so 
Malfoy’s going to have another clear shot at whatever 
he’s up to. No, listen to me!” he hissed angrily, as both 
Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. 
“I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of 
Page | 619 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Requirement. Here — ” He shoved the Marauder’s Map 
into Hermione’s hands. “You’ve got to watch him and 
you’ve got to watch Snape too. Use anyone else who 
you can rustle up from the D.A., Hermione, those 
contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore 
says he’s put extra protection in the school, but if 
Snape ’s involved, he’ll know what Dumbledore ’s 
protection is, and how to avoid it — but he won’t be 
expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?” 

“Harry — ” began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear. 

“I haven’t got time to argue,” said Harry curtly. “Take 
this as well — ” 

He thrust the socks into Ron’s hands. 

“Thanks,” said Ron. “Er — why do I need socks?” 

“You need what’s wrapped in them, it’s the Felix 
Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. 
Say good-bye to her for me. I’d better go, 

Dumbledore ’s waiting — ” 

“No!” said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little 
bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. “We don’t 
want it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to 
be facing?” 

“I’ll be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore,” said Harry. “I 
want to know you lot are okay. ... Don’t look like that, 
Hermione, I’ll see you later. ...” 

And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait 
hole and toward the entrance hall. 

Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front 
doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out onto the 



Page | 620 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in 
his side. 

“I would like you to wear your cloak, please,” said 
Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it 
on before saying, “Very good. Shall we go?” 

Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his 
own traveling cloak barely stirring in the still summer 
air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility 
Cloak, still panting and sweating rather a lot. 

“But what will people think when they see you 
leaving, Professor?” Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy 
and Snape. 

“That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,” said 
Dumbledore lightly. “I sometimes offer Rosmerta my 
custom, or else visit the Hog’s Head ... or I appear to. 
It is as good a way as any of disguising one’s true 
destination.” 

They made their way down the drive in the gathering 
twilight. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, 
lake water, and wood smoke from Hagrid’s cabin. It 
was difficult to believe that they were heading for 
anything dangerous or frightening. 

“Professor,” said Harry quietly, as the gates at the 
bottom of the drive came into view, “will we be 
Apparating?” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “You can Apparate now, I 
believe?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but I haven’t got a license.” 



Page | 621 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled 
everything by turning up a hundred miles from where 
he was supposed to go? 

“No matter,” said Dumbledore, “I can assist you 
again.” 

They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted 
lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they 
walked, and by the time they reached the High Street 
night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from 
windows over shops and as they neared the Three 
Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting. 

“ — and stay out!” shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly 
ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. “Oh, hello, Albus ... 
You’re out late ...” 

“Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening ... forgive me, 
I’m off to the Hog’s Head. ... No offense, but I feel like 
a quieter atmosphere tonight. ...” 

A minute later they turned the corner into the side 
street where the Hog’s Head’s sign creaked a little, 
though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three 
Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely 
empty. 

“It will not be necessary for us to enter,” muttered 
Dumbledore, glancing around. “As long as nobody 
sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, 
Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely 
guiding you. On the count of three ... One ... two ... 
three ...” 

Harry turned. At once, there was that horrible 
sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick 
rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of 
him was being compressed almost past endurance 

Page | 622 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, 
the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was 
standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of 
fresh, salty air. 



Page | 623 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 







THE CAVE 

Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a 
light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at 
moonlit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing 
upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and 
churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A 
towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black 
and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the 
one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were 
standing, looked as though they had broken away 
from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a 
bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by 
any tree or sweep of grass or sand. 

“What do you think?” asked Dumbledore. He might 
have been asking Harry’s opinion on whether it was a 
good site for a picnic. 

“They brought the kids from the orphanage here?” 
asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot 
for a day trip. 



Page | 624 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“Not here, precisely,” said Dumbledore. “There is a 
village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind 
us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little 
sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only 
ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited 
this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless 
they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats 
cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them 
are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed 
down; magic would have served better than ropes. 

And he brought two small children with him, 
probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think 
the journey alone would have done it, don’t you?” 

Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose 
bumps. 

“But his final destination — and ours — lies a little 
farther on. Come.” 

Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the 
rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds 
leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in 
water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous 
descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his 
withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were 
slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold 
salt spray hitting his face. 

“Lumos,” said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder 
closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden 
light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a 
few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of 
rock beside him was illuminated too. 

“You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand 
a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into 
which dark water was swirling. 



Page | 625 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You will not object to getting a little wet?” 

“No,” said Harry. 

“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no 
need for it now — and let us take the plunge.” 

And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, 
Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, 
and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, 
toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held 
in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into 
his pocket, and followed. 

The water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes 
billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking 
deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of 
salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, 
shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. 

The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry 
could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The 
slimy walls were barely three feet apart and 
glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of 
Dumbledore ’s wand. A little way in, the passageway 
curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far 
into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore ’s 
wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the 
rough, wet rock. 

Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water 
ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When 
Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a 
large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming 
from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering 
uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air. 



Page | 626 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, 
his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, 
examining the walls and ceiling. 

“Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore. 

“How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper. 

“It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply. 

Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was 
experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or 
to the same awareness of enchantments. He watched 
as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, 
evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. 

“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” 
said Dumbledore after a moment or two. “We need to 
penetrate the inner place. ... Now it is Lord 
Voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way, rather 
than those nature made. ...” 

Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and 
caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring 
words in a strange tongue that Harry did not 
understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around 
the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he 
could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers 
backward and forward over a particular spot, until 
finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the 
wall. 

“Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance 
is concealed.” 

Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had 
never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply 
by looking and touching; but Harry had long since 



Page | 627 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




learned that bangs and smoke were more often the 
marks of ineptitude than expertise. 

Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and 
pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an 
arched outline appeared there, blazing white as 
though there was a powerful light behind the crack. 

“You’ve d-done it!” said Harry through chattering 
teeth, but before the words had left his lips the 
outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid 
as ever. Dumbledore looked around. 

“Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” he said; he now pointed 
his wand at Harry and at once, Harry’s clothes were 
as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front 
of a blazing fire. 

“Thank you,” said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore 
had already turned his attention back to the solid 
cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply 
stood there staring at it intently, as though something 
extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed 
quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledore’s 
concentration. Then, after two solid minutes, 
Dumbledore said quietly, “Oh, surely not. So crude.” 

“What is it, Professor?” 

“I rather think,” said Dumbledore, putting his 
uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a 
short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop 
potion ingredients, “that we are required to make 
payment to pass.” 

“Payment?” said Harry. “You’ve got to give the door 
something?” 



Page | 628 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Blood, if I am not much 
mistaken.” 

“Blood?” 

“I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded 
disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort 
had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore 
expected. “The idea, as I am sure you will have 
gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or 
herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to 
grasp that there are much more terrible things than 
physical injury.” 

“Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it ...” said Harry, who 
had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more. 

“Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,” said 
Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and 
exposing the forearm of his injured hand. 

“Professor!” protested Harry, hurrying forward as 
Dumbledore raised his knife. “Ill do it, I’m — ” 

He did not know what he was going to say — younger, 
fitter? But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a 
flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face 
was peppered with dark, glistening drops. 

“You are very kind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, now 
passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had 
made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just 
as Snape had healed Malfoy’s wounds. “But your 
blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to 
have done the trick, doesn’t it?” 

The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in 
the wall once more, and this time it did not fade 
away: The blood-spattered rock within it simply 

Page | 629 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total 
darkness. 

“After me, I think,” said Dumbledore, and he walked 
through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting 
his own wand hastily as he went. 

An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on 
the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry 
could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so 
high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty 
greenish light shone far away in what looked like the 
middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely 
still water below. The greenish glow and the light from 
the two wands were the only things that broke the 
otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not 
penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The 
darkness was somehow denser than normal 
darkness. 

“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very 
careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.” 

He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry 
followed close behind him. Their footsteps made 
echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock 
that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, 
but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the 
rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless 
expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very 
middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. 
Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, 
unnerving. 

“Professor?” he said finally. “Do you think the 
Horcrux is here?” 

“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, I’m sure it is. The 
question is, how do we get to it?” 

Page | 630 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“We couldn’t ... we couldn’t just try a Summoning 
Charm?” Harry said, sure that it was a stupid 
suggestion. But he was much keener than he was 
prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon 
as possible. 

“Certainly we could,” said Dumbledore, stopping so 
suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. “Why 
don’t you do it?” 

“Me? Oh ... okay ...” 

Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat 
and said loudly, wand aloft, “Accio Horcruxl” 

With a noise like an explosion, something very large 
and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty 
feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had 
vanished again with a crashing splash that made 
great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry 
leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart 
was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. 

“What was that?” 

“Something, I think, that is ready to respond should 
we attempt to seize the Horcrux.” 

Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the 
lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples 
had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry’s heart, 
however, was still pounding. 

“Did you think that would happen, sir?” 

“I thought something would happen if we made an 
obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. 

That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest 
way of finding out what we are facing.” 

Page | 631 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“But we don’t know what the thing was,” said Harry, 
looking at the sinisterly smooth water. 



“What the things are, you mean,” said Dumbledore. “I 
doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall 
we walk on?” 

“Professor?” 

“Yes, Harry?” 

“Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?” 

“Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.” 

“You don’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?” 

“Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle.” 

And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light 
in the center of the lake. 

“So we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?” 
“Yes, I think so.” 

Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of 
water monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, 
and sprites. ... 

“Aha,” said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this 
time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he 
toppled on the edge of the dark water, and 
Dumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly around 
his upper arm, pulling him back. “So sorry, Harry, I 
should have given warning. Stand back against the 
wall, please; I think I have found the place.” 



Page | 632 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this 
patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as 
far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have 
detected something special about it. This time he was 
running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but 
through the thin air, as though expecting to find and 
grip something invisible. 

“Oho,” said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His 
hand had closed in midair upon something Harry 
could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; 
Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore ’s 
buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. 
Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore 
raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist 
with the point. 

Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared 
out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water 
into Dumbledore ’s clenched hand. Dumbledore 
tapped the chain, which began to slide through his 
fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a 
clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, 
pulling something from the depths of the black water. 
Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke 
the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and 
floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the 
bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. 

“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in 
astonishment. 

“Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the 
boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, “sometimes 
very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know 
his style.” 

“Is ... is this boat safe?” 



Page | 633 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a 
means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath 
of those creatures he had placed within it in case he 
ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.” 

“So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if 
we cross in Voldemort’s boat?” 

“I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they 
will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. 
Thus far, however, we have done well. They have 
allowed us to raise the boat.” 

“But why have they let us?” asked Harry, who could 
not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the 
dark water the moment they were out of sight of the 
bank. 

“Voldemort would have been reasonably confident 
that none but a very great wizard would have been 
able to find the boat,” said Dumbledore. “I think he 
would have been prepared to risk what was, to his 
mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody 
else would find it, knowing that he had set other 
obstacles ahead that only he would be able to 
penetrate. We shall see whether he is right.” 

Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very 
small. 

“It doesn’t look like it was built for two people. Will it 
hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?” 

Dumbledore chuckled. 

“Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but 
about the amount of magical power that crossed his 
lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been 



Page | 634 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a 
time will be able to sail in it.” 



“But then — ?” 

“I do not think you will count, Harry: You are 
underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never 
have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I 
think it unlikely that your powers will register 
compared to mine.” 

These words did nothing to raise Harry’s morale; 
perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, 
“Voldemort’s mistake, Harry, Voldemort’s mistake ... 
Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates 
youth. ... Now, you first this time, and be careful not 
to touch the water.” 

Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully 
into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the 
chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; 
Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his 
knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began 
to move at once. There was no sound other than the 
silken rustle of the boat’s prow cleaving the water; it 
moved without their help, as though an invisible rope 
was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. 
Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; 
they might have been at sea except that there were no 
waves. 

Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his 
wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water 
as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples 
upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. 



And then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches 
below the surface. 

Page | 635 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Professor!” he said, and his startled voice echoed 
loudly over the silent water. 



“Harry?” 

“I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!” 

“Yes, I am sure you did,” said Dumbledore calmly. 

Harry stared down into the water, looking for the 
vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat. 

“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?” 

But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could 
reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of 
water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying 
faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes 
misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his 
robes swirling around him like smoke. 

“There are bodies in here!” said Harry, and his voice 
sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his 
own. 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore placidly, “but we do not need 
to worry about them at the moment.” 

“At the moment?” Harry repeated, tearing his gaze 
from the water to look at Dumbledore. 

“Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below 
us,” said Dumbledore. “There is nothing to be feared 
from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything 
to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who 
of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once 
again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the 
unknown we fear when we look upon death and 
darkness, nothing more.” 

Page | 636 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he 
found the idea that there were bodies floating around 
them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, 
he did not believe that they were not dangerous. 

“But one of them jumped,” he said, trying to make his 
voice as level and calm as Dumbledore ’s. “When I 
tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the 
lake.” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I am sure that once we take 
the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. 
However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and 
darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall 
therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, 
Harry,” Dumbledore added with a smile, in response 
to Harry’s bewildered expression. 

“Oh ... right ...” said Harry quickly. He turned his 
head to look at the greenish glow toward which the 
boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend 
now that he was not scared. The great black lake, 
teeming with the dead ... It seemed hours and hours 
ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had 
given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. ... He suddenly 
wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and 
he hadn’t seen Ginny at all. ... 

“Nearly there,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. 

Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing 
larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come 
to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry 
could not see at first, but when he raised his 
illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a 
small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. 



“Careful not to touch the water,” said Dumbledore 
again as Harry climbed out of the boat. 

Page | 637 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The island was no larger than Dumbledore ’s office, an 
expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but 
the source of that greenish light, which looked much 
brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at 
first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then 
he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin 
rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a 
pedestal. 

Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry 
followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The 
basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that 
phosphorescent glow. 

“What is it?” asked Harry quietly. 

“I am not sure,” said Dumbledore. “Something more 
worrisome than blood and bodies, however.” 

Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over 
his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his 
burned fingers toward the surface of the potion. 

“Sir, no, don’t touch — !” 

“I cannot touch,” said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. 
“See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You 
try.” 

Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and 
attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible 
barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of 
it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers 
encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and 
inflexible air. 

“Out of the way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He 
raised his wand and made complicated movements 
over the surface of the potion, murmuring 

Page | 638 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that 
the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained 
silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while 
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was 
safe to talk again. 

“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?” 

“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the 
basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in 
the smooth surface of the green potion. “But how to 
reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, 
Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor 
can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made 
to change its nature.” 

Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand 
again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the 
crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. 

“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to 
be drunk.” 

“What?” said Harry. “No!” 

“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the 
basin and see what lies in its depths.” 

“But what if — what if it kills you?” 

“Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,” said 
Dumbledore easily. “Lord Voldemort would not want 
to kill the person who reached this island.” 

Harry couldn’t believe it. Was this more of 
Dumbledore ’s insane determination to see good in 
everyone? 



Page | 639 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sir,” said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, 
“sir, this is Voldemort we’re — ” 

“I’m sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not 
want to immediately kill the person who reached this 
island,” Dumbledore corrected himself. “He would 
want to keep them alive long enough to find out how 
they managed to penetrate so far through his 
defenses and, most importantly of all, why they were 
so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that 
Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about 
his Horcruxes.” 

Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore 
raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the 
emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. 

“Undoubtedly,” he said, finally, “this potion must act 
in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It 
might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here 
for, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me 
incapable in some other way. This being the case, 
Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep 
drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my 
protesting mouth. You understand?” 

Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with 
that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was 
this why he had been invited along — so that he 
could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might 
cause him unendurable pain? 

“You remember,” said Dumbledore, “the condition on 
which I brought you with me?” 

Harry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had 
turned green in the reflected light of the basin. 

“But what if — ?” 

Page | 640 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You swore, did you not, to follow any command I 
gave you?” 

“Yes, but — ” 

“I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, “but — ” 

“Well, then,” said Dumbledore, shaking back his 
sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, “you 
have my orders.” 

“Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked Harry 
desperately. 

“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much 
less valuable,” said Dumbledore. “Once and for all, 
Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your 
power to make me keep drinking?” 

“Couldn’t — ?” 

“Do I have it?” 

“But — ” 

“ Your word, Harry.” 

“I — all right, but — ” 

Before Harry could make any further protest, 
Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the 
potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would 
not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but 
the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; 
when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted 
it to his mouth. 



Page | 641 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Your good health, Harry.” 

And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, 
his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that 
his fingertips were numb. 

“Professor?” he said anxiously, as Dumbledore 
lowered the empty glass. “How do you feel?” 

Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry 
wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore 
plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled 
it, and drank once more. 

In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the 
potion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he 
staggered and fell forward against the basin. His eyes 
were still closed, his breathing heavy. 

“Professor Dumbledore?” said Harry, his voice 
strained. “Can you hear me?” 

Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching 
as though he was deeply asleep, but dreaming a 
horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; 
the potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached 
forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it 
steady. 

“Professor, can you hear me?” he repeated loudly, his 
voice echoing around the cavern. 

Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry 
did not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore 
frightened like this. 

“I don’t want ... Don’t make me ...” 



Page | 642 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, 
at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and 
did not know what to do. 

"... don’t like ... want to stop ...” moaned Dumbledore. 

“You ... you can’t stop, Professor,” said Harry. “You’ve 
got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had 
to keep drinking. Here ...” 

Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry 
forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore ’s mouth 
and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the 
remainder of the potion inside. 

“No ...” he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back 
into the basin and refilled it for him. “I don’t want to. 
...I don’t want to. ... Let me go. ...” 

“It’s all right, Professor,” said Harry, his hand 
shaking. “It’s all right, I’m here — ” 

“Make it stop, make it stop,” moaned Dumbledore. 

“Yes ... yes, this’ll make it stop,” lied Harry. He tipped 
the contents of the goblet into Dumbledore ’s open 
mouth. 

Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around 
the vast chamber, across the dead black water. 

“No, no, no, no, I can’t, I can’t, don’t make me, I don’t 
want to. ...” 

“It’s all right, Professor, it’s all right!” said Harry 
loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly 
scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion; the basin was 
now half empty. “Nothing’s happening to you, you’re 



Page | 643 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




safe, it isn’t real, I swear it isn’t real — take this, now, 
take this. ...” 

And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was 
an antidote Harry offered him, but upon draining the 
goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably. 

“It’s all my fault, all my fault,” he sobbed. “Please 
make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it 
stop and I’ll never, never again ...” 

“This will make it stop, Professor,” Harry said, his 
voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of 
potion into Dumbledore’s mouth. 

Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible 
torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost 
knocked the refilled goblet from Harry’s trembling 
hands as he moaned, “Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt 
them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead ...” 

“Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said 
Harry desperately, and once again Dumbledore 
obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his 
eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. 

And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering 
his fists upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth 
goblet. 

“Please, please, please, no ... not that, not that, I’ll do 
anything ...” 

“Just drink, Professor, just drink ...” 

Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but 
when he had finished, he yelled again as though his 
insides were on fire. “No more, please, no more ...” 



Page | 644 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt 
the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin. 



“We’re nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. ...” 

He supported Dumbledore’s shoulders and again, 
Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his 
feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore 
began to scream in more anguish than ever, “I want 
to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want 
to die!” 

“Drink this, Professor. Drink this. ...” 

Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished 
than he yelled, “KILL ME!” 

“This — this one will!” gasped Harry. “Just drink this 
... It’ll be over ... all over!” 

Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last 
drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over 
onto his face. 

“No!” shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet 
again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, 
flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved 
him over onto his back; Dumbledore’s glasses were 
askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. “No,” said 
Harry, shaking Dumbledore, “no, you’re not dead, you 
said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — 
Rennervatel” he cried, his wand pointing at 
Dumbledore’s chest; there was a flash of red light but 
nothing happened. “Renneruate — sir — please — ” 

Dumbledore’s eyelids flickered; Harry’s heart leapt. 

“Sir, are you — ?” 

Page | 645 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Water,” croaked Dumbledore. 

“Water,” panted Harry. “Yes — ” 

He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had 
dropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden 
locket lying curled beneath it. 

“Aguamenti\” he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his 
wand. 

The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to 
his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and 
brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty. 
Dumbledore groaned and began to pant. 

“But I had some — wait — AguamentiV’ said Harry 
again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for 
a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he 
approached Dumbledore ’s mouth, the water vanished 
again. 

“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, 
but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear 
him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing 
great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. 
“Aguamenti — Aguamenti — A GUAMENTP. ” 

The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now 
Dumbledore ’s breathing was fading. His brain 
whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only 
way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned 
it so ... 

He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and 
plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to 
the brim of icy water that did not vanish. 



Page | 646 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sir — here!” Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he 
tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledore’s face. 

It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his 
arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of 
the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, 
and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling 
him, slowly, backward across the rock. The surface of 
the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was 
churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads 
and hands were emerging from the dark water, men 
and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes 
were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead 
rising from the black water. 

“Petrificus Totalusl” yelled Harry, struggling to cling to 
the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he 
pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm: It 
released him, falling backward into the water with a 
splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi 
were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands 
clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted 
eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken 
faces leering. 

“Petrificus Totalusl” Harry bellowed again, backing 
away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or 
seven of them crumpled, but more were coming 
toward him. “Impedimental Incarcerousl ” 

A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in 
ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them 
merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still 
slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, 

“ Sectumsempral SECTUMSEMPRAl” 

But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and 
their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked 
on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched 

Page | 647 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he 
felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless 
arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as 
they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and 
surely, back to the water, and he knew there would 
be no release, that he would be drowned, and become 
one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort’s 
shattered soul. ... 

But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson 
and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so 
that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and 
faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to 
get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the 
ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his 
arms, but scrambled back up, raising his wand and 
staring around. 

Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the 
surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire 
dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch 
and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast 
lasso, encircling them all with warmth. 

The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, 
blindly, to escape the fire in which they were 
enclosed. ... 

Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of 
the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. 
Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. 
Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware 
that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led 
Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with 
them, around them, the bewildered Inferi 
accompanying them to the water’s edge, where they 
slipped gratefully back into their dark waters. 



Page | 648 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a 
moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb 
into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; 
all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the 
ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized 
him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were 
both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to 
move back across the black water, away from the 
rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed 
that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare 
resurface. 

“Sir,” panted Harry, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they 
were coming at me and I panicked — ” 

“Quite understandable,” murmured Dumbledore. 
Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. 

They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry 
leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. 
The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he 
let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but 
the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The 
little boat sank into the water once more; clanking 
and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake 
too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against 
the cavern wall. 

“I am weak. ...” he said. 

“Don’t worry, sir,” said Harry at once, anxious about 
Dumbledore ’s extreme pallor and by his air of 
exhaustion. “Don’t worry, I’ll get us back. ... Lean on 
me, sir. ...” 

And pulling Dumbledore ’s uninjured arm around his 
shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around 
the lake, bearing most of his weight. 



Page | 649 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“The protection was ... after all ... well-designed,” said 
Dumbledore faintly. “One alone could not have done 
it. ... You did well, very well, Harry. ...” 

“Don’t talk now,” said Harry, fearing how slurred 
Dumbledore’s voice had become, how much his feet 
dragged. “Save your energy, sir. ... We’ll soon be out 
of here. ...” 

“The archway will have sealed again. ... My knife ...” 

“There’s no need, I got cut on the rock,” said Harry 
firmly. “Just tell me where. ...” 

“Here ...” 

Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: 
Having received its tribute of blood, the archway 
reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and 
Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater 
that filled the crevice in the cliff. 

“It’s going to be all right, sir,” Harry said over and 
over again, more worried by Dumbledore’s silence 
than he had been by his weakened voice. “We’re 
nearly there. ... I can Apparate us both back. ... Don’t 
worry. ...” 

“I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice 
a little stronger despite the freezing water. “I am with 
you.” 



Page | 650 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






THE LIGHTNING-STRUCK TOWER 

Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved 
Dumbledore onto the top of the nearest boulder and 
then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore’s 
weight still upon him, Harry concentrated harder 
than he had ever done upon his destination: 
Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore’s 
arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forward into 
that feeling of horrible compression. 

He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: The 
smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and 
Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the 
middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one 
horrible moment Harry’s imagination showed him 
more Inferi creeping toward him around the sides of 
shops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was 
stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a 
few streetlamps and lit upper windows. 



Page | 651 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“We did it, Professor!” Harry whispered with difficulty; 
he suddenly realized that he had a searing stitch in 
his chest. “We did it! We got the Horcrux!” 

Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, 
Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had 
thrown Dumbledore off balance; then he saw his face, 
paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a 
streetlamp. 

“Sir, are you all right?” 

“I’ve been better,” said Dumbledore weakly, though 
the corners of his mouth twitched. “That potion ... 
was no health drink. ...” 

And to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the 
ground. 

“Sir — it’s okay, sir, you’re going to be all right, don’t 
worry — ” 

He looked around desperately for help, but there was 
nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he 
must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the 
hospital wing. 

“We need to get you up to the school, sir. ... Madam 
Pomfrey ...” 

“No,” said Dumbledore. “It is ... Professor Snape 
whom I need. ... But I do not think ... I can walk very 
far just yet. ...” 

“Right — sir, listen — I’m going to knock on a door, 
find a place you can stay — then I can run and get 
Madam — ” 



Page | 652 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Severus,” said Dumbledore clearly. “I need Severus. 



“All right then, Snape — but I’m going to have to leave 
you for a moment so I can — ” 

Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard 
running footsteps. His heart leapt: Somebody had 
seen, somebody knew they needed help — and 
looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying 
down the dark street toward them on high-heeled, 
fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing gown 
embroidered with dragons. 

“I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom 
curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn’t 
think what to — but what’s wrong with Albus?” 

She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide- 
eyed, at Dumbledore. 

“He’s hurt,” said Harry. “Madam Rosmerta, can he 
come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the 
school and get help for him?” 

“You can’t go up there alone! Don’t you realize — 
haven’t you seen — ? 

“If you help me support him,” said Harry, not 
listening to her, “I think we can get him inside — ” 

“What has happened?” asked Dumbledore. 

“Rosmerta, what’s wrong?” 

“The — the Dark Mark, Albus.” 

And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of 
Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the 
words. ... He turned and looked. 

Page | 653 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the 
blazing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark 
Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a 
building ... wherever they had murdered. ... 

“When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his 
hand clenched painfully upon Harry’s shoulder as he 
struggled to his feet. 

“Must have been minutes ago, it wasn’t there when I 
put the cat out, but when I got upstairs — ” 

“We need to return to the castle at once,” said 
Dumbledore. “Rosmerta” — and though he staggered 
a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation 
— “we need transport — brooms — ” 

“I’ve got a couple behind the bar,” she said, looking 
very frightened. “Shall I run and fetch — ?” 

“No, Harry can do it.” 

Harry raised his wand at once. 

“Accio Rosmerta’s Broomsl” 

A second later they heard a loud bang as the front 
door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out 
into the street and were racing each other to Harry’s 
side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly at 
waist height. 

“Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,” 
said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest 
him. “It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has 
yet realized anything is wrong. . . . Harry, put on your 
Invisibility Cloak.” 



Page | 654 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it 
over himself before mounting his broom: Madam 
Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub 
as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground 
and rose up into the air. As they sped toward the 
castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready 
to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark 
Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a 
stimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes 
fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard 
flying behind him on the night air. And Harry too 
looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him 
like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, 
driving all other discomfort from his mind. ... 

How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione, 
and Ginny’s luck run out by now? Was it one of them 
who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or 
was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the 
D.A.? And if it was ... he was the one who had told 
them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to 
leave the safety of their beds. ... Would he be 
responsible, again, for the death of a friend? 

As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which 
they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the 
whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore 
muttering in some strange language again. He 
thought he understood why as he felt his broom 
shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into 
the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the 
enchantments he himself had set around the castle 
so they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was 
glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the 
highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had 
occurred there? 



Page | 655 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated 
ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to 
him seconds later and looked around. 

The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral 
staircase that led back into the castle was closed. 
There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the 
death, of a body. 

“What does it mean?” Harry asked Dumbledore, 
looking up at the green skull with its serpent’s tongue 
glinting evilly above them. “Is it the real Mark? Has 
someone definitely been — Professor?” 

In the dim green glow from the Mark, Harry saw 
Dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened 
hand. 

“Go and wake Severus,” said Dumbledore faintly but 
clearly. “Tell him what has happened and bring him 
to me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody else, and do 
not remove your cloak. I shall wait here.” 

“But — ” 

“You swore to obey me, Harry — go!” 

Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral 
staircase, but his hand had only just closed upon the 
iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps 
on the other side. He looked around at Dumbledore, 
who gestured him to retreat. Harry backed away, 
drawing his wand as he did so. 

The door burst open and somebody erupted through 
it and shouted, “Expelliarmus\” 

Harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, 
and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall, 

Page | 656 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or 
speak. He could not understand how it had happened 
— Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm — 

Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore ’s 
wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts 
and understood. ... Dumbledore had wordlessly 
immobilized Harry, and the second he had taken to 
perform the spell had cost him the chance of 
defending himself. 

Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, 
Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. 
He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, 
“Good evening, Draco.” 

Malfoy stepped forward, glancing around quickly to 
check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes 
fell upon the second broom. 

“Who else is here?” 

“A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?” 

Harry saw Malfoy’s pale eyes shift back to 
Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark. 

“No,” he said. “I’ve got backup. There are Death 
Eaters here in your school tonight.” 

“Well, well,” said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was 
showing him an ambitious homework project. “Very 
good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did 
you?” 

“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who was panting. “Right under 
your nose and you never realized!” 



Page | 657 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “Yet ... forgive me ... 
where are they now? You seem unsupported.” 

“They met some of your guards. They’re having a fight 
down below. They won’t be long. ... I came on ahead. I 
— I’ve got a job to do.” 

“Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,” 
said Dumbledore softly. 

There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his 
own invisible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of 
them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death 
Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, Draco 
Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore, 
who, incredibly, smiled. 

“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.” 

“How do you know?” said Malfoy at once. 

He seemed to realize how childish the words had 
sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Mark’s greenish 
light. 

“You don’t know what I’m capable of,” said Malfoy 
more forcefully. “You don’t know what I’ve done!” 

“Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly. “You almost 
killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been 
trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. 
Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble 
attempts. ... So feeble, to be honest, that I wonder 
whether your heart has been really in it.” 

“It has been in it!” said Malfoy vehemently. “I’ve been 
working on it all year, and tonight — ” 



Page | 658 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry 
heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced 
over his shoulder. 

“Somebody is putting up a good fight,” said 
Dumbledore conversationally. “But you were saying ... 
yes, you have managed to introduce Death Eaters 
into my school, which, I admit, I thought impossible. 

. . . How did you do it?” 

But Malfoy said nothing: He was still listening to 
whatever was happening below and seemed almost as 
paralyzed as Harry was. 

“Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,” 
suggested Dumbledore. “What if your backup has 
been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps 
realized, there are members of the Order of the 
Phoenix here tonight too. And after all, you don’t 
really need help. ... I have no wand at the moment. ... 

I cannot defend myself.” 

Malfoy merely stared at him. 

“I see,” said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither 
moved nor spoke. “You are afraid to act until they join 
you.” 

“I’m not afraid!” snarled Malfoy, though he still made 
no move to hurt Dumbledore. “It’s you who should be 
scared!” 

“But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing 
is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe. ... So tell 
me, while we wait for your friends ... how did you 
smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a 
long time to work out how to do it.” 



Page | 659 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the 
urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several 
deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand 
pointing directly at the latter’s heart. Then, as though 
he could not help himself, he said, “I had to mend 
that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one’s used for 
years. The one Montague got lost in last year.” 

“Aaaah.” Dumbledore’s sigh was half a groan. He 
closed his eyes for a moment. “That was clever. ... 
There is a pair, I take it?” 

“In Borgin and Burkes,” said Malfoy, “and they make 
a kind of passage between them. Montague told me 
that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was 
trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what 
was going on at school, and sometimes what was 
going on in the shop, as if the cabinet was traveling 
between them, but he couldn’t make anyone hear 
him. ... In the end, he managed to Apparate out, even 
though he’d never passed his test. He nearly died 
doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, 
but I was the only one who realized what it meant — 
even Borgin didn’t know — I was the one who realized 
there could be a way into Hogwarts through the 
cabinets if I fixed the broken one.” 

“Very good,” murmured Dumbledore. “So the Death 
Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into 
the school to help you. ... A clever plan, a very clever 
plan ... and, as you say, right under my nose.” 

“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who bizarrely seemed to draw 
courage and comfort from Dumbledore’s praise. 

“Yeah, it was!” 

“But there were times,” Dumbledore went on, “weren’t 
there, when you were not sure you would succeed in 
mending the cabinet? And you resorted to crude and 

Page | 660 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed 
necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands . . 
poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I 
might drink. ...” 

“Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind 
that stuff, did you?” sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore 
slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his 
legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled 
fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding 
him. 

“As a matter of fact, I did,” said Dumbledore. “I was 
sure it was you. 

“Why didn’t you stop me, then?” Malfoy demanded. 

“I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping 
watch over you on my orders — ” 

“He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my 
mother — ” 

“Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but 



“He’s a double agent, you stupid old man, he isn’t 
working for you, you just think he is!” 

“We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens 
that I trust Professor Snape — ” 

“Well, you’re losing your grip, then!” sneered Malfoy. 
“He’s been offering me plenty of help — wanting all 
the glory for himself — wanting a bit of the action — 
What are you doing?’ ‘Did you do the necklace, that 
was stupid, it could have blown everything — ’ But I 
haven’t told him what I’ve been doing in the Room of 
Requirement, he’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll 
Page | 661 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




all be over and he won’t be the Dark Lord’s favorite 
anymore, he’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!” 



“Very gratifying,” said Dumbledore mildly. “We all like 
appreciation for our own hard work, of course. But 
you must have had an accomplice, all the same ... 
someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to 
slip Katie the — the — aaaah ...” 

Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as 
though he was about to fall asleep. "... of course ... 
Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius 
Curse?” 

“Got there at last, have you?” Malfoy taunted. 

There was another yell from below, rather louder than 
the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder 
again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on: “So 
poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own 
bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts 
student who entered the room unaccompanied? And 
the poisoned mead ... well, naturally, Rosmerta was 
able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to 
Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas 
present. ... Yes, very neat ... very neat ... Poor Mr. 
Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of 
Rosmerta’s. Tell me, how have you been 
communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all 
methods of communication in and out of the school 
monitored.” 

“Enchanted coins,” said Malfoy, as though he was 
compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was 
shaking badly. “I had one and she had the other and I 
could send her messages — ” 

“Isn’t that the secret method of communication the 
group that called themselves Dumbledore ’s Army 

Page | 662 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




used last year?” asked Dumbledore. His voice was 
light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an 
inch lower down the wall as he said it. 

“Yeah, I got the idea from them,” said Malfoy, with a 
twisted smile. “I got the idea of poisoning the mead 
from the Mudblood Granger as well, I heard her 
talking in the library about Filch not recognizing 
potions.” 

“Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,” 
said Dumbledore. 

Malfoy gave a harsh laugh. “You care about me saying 
‘Mudblood’ when I’m about to kill you?” 

“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet 
slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain 
upright. “But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you 
have had several long minutes now, we are quite 
alone, I am more defenseless than you can have 
dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted. 



Malfoy’s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he 
had tasted something very bitter. 

“Now, about tonight,” Dumbledore went on, “I am a 
little puzzled about how it happened. ... You knew 
that I had left the school? But of course,” he 
answered his own question, “Rosmerta saw me 
leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious 
coins, I’m sure.” 

“That’s right,” said Malfoy. “But she said you were 
just going for a drink, you’d be back. ...” 



Page | 663 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I certainly did have a drink ... and I came back 
... after a fashion,” mumbled Dumbledore. “So you 
decided to spring a trap for me?” 

“We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and 
get you to hurry up here, to see who’d been killed,” 
said Malfoy. “And it worked!” 

“Well ... yes and no ...” said Dumbledore. “But am I to 
take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?” 

“Someone’s dead,” said Malfoy, and his voice seemed 
to go up an octave as he said it. “One of your people 
...I don’t know who, it was dark. ... I stepped over the 
body. ... I was supposed to be waiting up here when 
you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way. ...” 

“Yes, they do that,” said Dumbledore. 

There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than 
ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the 
actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, 
Malfoy, and Harry stood, and Harry’s heart thundered 
unheard in his invisible chest. ... Someone was dead. 

. . . Malfoy had stepped over the body . . . but who was 
it? 



“There is little time, one way or another,” said 
Dumbledore. “So let us discuss your options, Draco.” 

“My options!” said Malfoy loudly. “I’m standing here 
with a wand — I’m about to kill you — ” 

“My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about 
that. If you were going to kill me, you would have 
done it when you first disarmed me, you would not 
have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and 
means.” 



Page | 664 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I haven’t got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was 
suddenly white as Dumbledore. “I’ve got to do it! He’ll 
kill me! He’ll kill my whole family!” 

“I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said 
Dumbledore. “Why else do you think I have not 
confronted you before now? Because I knew that you 
would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized 
that I suspected you.” 

Malfoy winced at the sound of the name. 

“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which 
I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used 
Legilimency against you,” continued Dumbledore. 

“But now at last we can speak plainly to each other. 

... No harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, 
though you are very lucky that your unintentional 
victims survived. ... I can help you, Draco.” 

“No, you can’t,” said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking 
very badly indeed. “Nobody can. He told me to do it or 
he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.” 

“Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide 
you more completely than you can possibly imagine. 
What is more, I can send members of the Order to 
your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father 
is safe at the moment in Azkaban. ... When the time 
comes, we can protect him too. Come over to the right 
side, Draco ... you are not a killer. ...” 

Malfoy stared at Dumbledore. 

“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly. “They 
thought I’d die in the attempt, but I’m here ... and 
you’re in my power. ... I’m the one with the wand. ... 
You’re at my mercy. ...” 



Page | 665 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, Draco,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It is my mercy, 
and not yours, that matters now.” 

Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand 
hand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by 
a fraction — 

But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, 
and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way 
as four people in black robes burst through the door 
onto the ramparts. Still paralyzed, his eyes staring 
unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four 
strangers: It seemed the Death Eaters had won the 
fight below. 

A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a 
wheezy giggle. 

“Dumbledore cornered!” he said, and he turned to a 
stocky little woman who looked as though she could 
be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. 
“Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, 
Draco, well done!” 

“Good evening, Amycus,” said Dumbledore calmly, as 
though welcoming the man to a tea party. “And you’ve 
brought Alecto too. ... Charming ...” 

The woman gave an angry little titter. “Think your 
little jokes’ll help you on your deathbed then?” she 
jeered. 

“Jokes? No, no, these are manners,” replied 
Dumbledore. 

“Do it,” said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a 
big, rangy man with matted gray hair and whiskers, 
whose black Death Eater’s robes looked 
uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that 

Page | 666 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry 
could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat, and, 
unmistakably, of blood coming from him. His filthy 
hands had long yellowish nails. 

“Is that you, Fenrir?” asked Dumbledore. 

“That’s right,” rasped the other. “Pleased to see me, 
Dumbledore?” 

“No, I cannot say that I am.” 

Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood 
trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, 
obscenely. 

“But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.” 

“Am I to take it that you are attacking even without 
the full moon now? This is most unusual. ... You have 
developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be 
satisfied once a month?” 

“That’s right,” said Fenrir Greyback. “Shocks you 
that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?” 

“Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,” 
said Dumbledore. “And, yes, I am a little shocked that 
Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school 
where his friends live. ...” 

“I didn’t,” breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at 
Fenrir; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. 
“I didn’t know he was going to come — ” 

“I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, 
Dumbledore,” rasped Greyback. “Not when there are 
throats to be ripped out... Delicious, delicious ...” 



Page | 667 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his 
front teeth, leering at Dumbledore. “I could do you for 
afters, Dumbledore.” 

“No,” said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a 
heavy, brutal-looking face. “We’ve got orders. Draco’s 
got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.” 

Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He 
looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore ’s face, 
which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, 
as he had slid so far down the rampart wall. 

“He’s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!” 
said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his 
sister’s wheezing giggles. “Look at him — what’s 
happened to you, then, Dumby?” 

“Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,” 
said Dumbledore. “Old age, in short ... One day, 
perhaps, it will happen to you ... if you are lucky. ...” 

“What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?” yelled 
the Death Eater, suddenly violent. “Always the same, 
weren’t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, 
nothing. I don’t even know why the Dark Lord’s 
bothering to kill yer! Come on, Draco, do it!” 

But at that moment there were renewed sounds of 
scuffling from below and a voice shouted, “ They’ve 
blocked the stairs — Reductol REDUCTOl” 

Harry’s heart leapt: So these four had not eliminated 
all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to 
the top of the tower, and, by the sound of it, created a 
barrier behind them — 

“Now, Draco, quickly!” said the brutal-faced man 
angrily. 

Page | 668 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




But Malfoy’s hand was shaking so badly that he could 
barely aim. 

“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore 
with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared. 

“I said no!” shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a 
flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the 
way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking 
furious. Harry’s heart was hammering so hard it 
seemed impossible that nobody could hear him 
standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore ’s spell — 
if he could only move, he could aim a curse from 
under the cloak — 

“Draco, do it or stand aside so one of us — ” screeched 
the woman, but at that precise moment, the door to 
the ramparts burst open once more and there stood 
Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black 
eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped 
against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including 
the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy. 

“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said the lumpy 
Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon 
Dumbledore, “the boy doesn’t seem able — ” 

But somebody else had spoken Snape’s name, quite 
softly. 

“Severus ...” 

The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had 
experienced all evening. For the first time, 

Dumbledore was pleading. 

Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed 
Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters 



Page | 669 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed 
cowed. 

Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there 
was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of 
his face. 

“Severus ... please ...” 

Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at 
Dumbledore. 

“Avada KedavraV’ 

A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand 
and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry’s 
scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, 
he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted 
into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang 
suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell 
slowly backward, like a great rag doll, over the 
battlements and out of sight. 



Page | 670 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE 

Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through 
space; it had not happened. ...It could not have 
happened. ... 

“Out of here, quickly,” said Snape. 

He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced 
him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and 
the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both 
panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, 
Harry realized he could move again. What was now 
holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, 
but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak 
aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave 
the tower top, was disappearing through the door. 

“Petrificus Totalusl” 

The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back 
with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a 
waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry 



Page | 671 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



was clambering over him and running down the 
darkened staircase. 

Terror tore at Harry’s heart. ... He had to get to 
Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ... Somehow 
the two things were linked. ... He could reverse what 
had happened if he had them both together. . . . 
Dumbledore could not have died. ... 

He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and 
stopped where he landed, his wand raised: The dimly 
lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to 
have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but 
even as he attempted to make out who was fighting 
whom, he heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time 
to go\” and saw Snape disappearing around the corner 
at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed 
to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. 
As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters 
detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: It 
was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry 
before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell 
backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the 
stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, 
hot greedy breath at his throat — 

“Petrificus Totalusl” 

Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a 
stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and 
onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying 
toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the 
fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on 
the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies 
lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but 
there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red 
hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was 
locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, 
Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while 
Page | 672 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the 
sport: “Crucio — Crucio — you can’t dance forever, 
pretty — ” 

“Impedimenta).” yelled Harry. 

His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike 
squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed 
into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of 
sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, 
each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. 
Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous 
blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all 
directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls 
around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest 
window — 

“Harry, where did you come from?” Ginny cried, but 
there was no time to answer her. He put his head 
down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast 
that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits 
of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up 
with Snape — 

“Take that\” shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry 
glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting 
away down the corridor with her arms over her head, 
her brother right behind her. He launched himself 
after them but his foot caught on something, and next 
moment he was lying across someone’s legs. Looking 
around, he saw Neville’s pale, round face flat against 
the floor. 

“Neville, are you — ?” 

“M’all right,” muttered Neville, who was clutching his 
stomach, “Harry ... Snape ’n’ Malfoy ... ran past ...” 



Page | 673 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I know, I’m on it!” said Harry, aiming a hex from the 
floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was 
causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of 
pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled 
around, staggered, and then pounded away after the 
brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor 
and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the 
bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others 
to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the 
ground whose fate he did not yet know. ... 

He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery 
with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it 
possible that he had already entered the cabinet in 
the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made 
steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters 
retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his 
own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he 
sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then 
spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of 
the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front 
doors — perhaps the Room of Requirement was 
indeed blocked — 

He skidded around another corner and a curse flew 
past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that 
exploded. He saw the brother and sister running 
down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at 
them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a 
portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into 
neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of 
armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other 
people within the castle seemed to have awoken. ... 

He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the 
brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, 
who must surely have reached the grounds by now. 
Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway 
down the concealed staircase, he burst through a 
Page | 674 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a 
number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs 
stood. 

“Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said 
something about the Dark Mark — ” began Ernie 
Macmillan. 

“Out of the way!” yelled Harry, knocking two boys 
aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the 
remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front 
doors had been blasted open, there were smears of 
blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students 
stood huddled against the walls, one or two still 
cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant 
Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the 
rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto 
the flagstones below. 

Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the 
dark grounds: He could just make out three figures 
racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond 
which they could Disapparate — by the looks of them, 
the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of 
him, Snape and Malfoy ... 

The cold night air ripped at Harry’s lungs as he tore 
after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that 
momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know 
what it was but continued to run, not yet near 
enough to get a good aim with a curse — 

Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and 
Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his 
cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters 
escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred 
his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, 
Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: 
not Hagrid . . . not Hagrid too . . . 

Page | 675 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back 
and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, 
blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as 
he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and 
sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were 
closing in behind him. ... 

“Impedimenta).” he yelled as he rolled over again, 
crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously 
his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, 
tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and 
sprinted on after Snape. 

And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, 
illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed 
suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was 
aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but 
Hagrid’s immense strength and the toughened skin 
he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to 
be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were 
still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, 
able to Disapparate — 

Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at 
Snape’s back, and yelled, “Stupefy\” 

He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape’s 
head; Snape shouted, “Run, Draco\” and turned. 
Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each 
other before raising their wands simultaneously. 

“Cruc — ” 

But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry 
backward off his feet before he could complete it; 
Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the 
huge Death Eater behind him yelled, “Incendiol” Harry 
heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light 
spilled over all of them: Hagrid’s house was on fire. 
Page | 676 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Fang’s in there, yer evil — !” Hagrid bellowed. 

“Cruc — ” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for 
the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, 
but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see 
him sneering. 

“No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!” he 
shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid’s yells, 
and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. “You haven’t 
got the nerve or the ability — ” 

“Incarc — ” Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell 
with an almost lazy flick of his arm. 

“Fight back!” Harry screamed at him. “Fight back, you 
cowardly — ” 

“Coward, did you call me, Potter?” shouted Snape. 
“Your father would never attack me unless it was four 
on one, what would you call him, I wonder?” 

“ Stupe — ” 

“Blocked again and again and again until you learn to 
keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!” 
sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. “Now 
come!” he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind 
Harry. “It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns 
up — ” 



“Impedi — ” 

But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain 
hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was 
screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape 
was going to torture him to death or madness — 



Page | 677 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No!” roared Snape’s voice and the pain stopped as 
suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the 
dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; 
somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, “Have you 
forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord 
— we are to leave him! Go! Go!” 

And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as 
the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater 
obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an 
inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not 
whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet 
again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he 
now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself — 

“Sectum — !” 

Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet 
again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he 
could see Snape’s face clearly at last: He was no 
longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed 
a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of 
concentration, Harry thought, Levi — 

“No, Potter!” screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG 
and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground 
hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his 
hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling 
as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he 
lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had 
been. Snape’s pale face, illuminated by the flaming 
cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been 
before he had cursed Dumbledore. 

“You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It 
was I who invented them — I, the Half-Blood Prince! 
And you’d turn my inventions on me, like your filthy 
father, would you? I don’t think so ... no!” 



Page | 678 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it 
and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of 
sight. 

“Kill me then,” panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, 
but only rage and contempt. “Kill me like you killed 
him, you coward — ” 

“DONT — ” screamed Snape, and his face was 
suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in 
as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the 
burning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!” 

And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, 
whiplike something hit him across the face and was 
slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light 
burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the 
breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he 
heard a rush of wings above him and something 
enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at 
Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp 
claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a 
sitting position, his head still swimming from its last 
contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as 
hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind 
him and screeching as Harry had never heard him 
screech — 

Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for 
his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his 
fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he 
knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the 
time he had located his wand, he turned only to see 
the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed 
to Disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries. 

“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. 
“HAGRID?” 



Page | 679 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He stumbled toward the burning house as an 
enormous figure emerged from out of the flames 
carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of 
thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was 
shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and 
his breath came in painful stabs. 

“Yeh all righ’, Harry? Yeh all righ’? Speak ter me, 
Harry. ...” 

Hagrid’s huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, 
blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood 
and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang’s 
reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside 
him. 

“I’m all right,” panted Harry. “Are you?” 

“ ’Course I am ... take more’n that ter finish me.” 

Hagrid put his hands under Harry’s arms and raised 
him up with such force that Harry’s feet momentarily 
left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. 

He could see blood trickling down Hagrid’s cheek 
from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling 
rapidly. 

“We should put out your house,” said Harry, “the 
charm’s ‘Aguamenti’ ...” 

“Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled Hagrid, 
and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella 
and said, “Aguamenti\” 

A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry 
raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and 
murmured “Aguamenti’ too: Together, he and Hagrid 
poured water on the house until the last flame was 
extinguished. 

Page | 680 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“S’not too bad,” said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes 
later, looking at the smoking wreck. “Nothin’ 
Dumbledore won’ be able to put righ’ ...” 

Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound 
of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror 
rose inside him. 

“Hagrid ...” 

“I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I 
heard ’em cornin’,” said Hagrid sadly, still staring at 
his wrecked cabin. “They’ll’ve bin burnt ter twigs, 
poor little things. ...” 

“Hagrid ...” 

“But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death 
Eaters runnin’ down from the castle, but what the 
ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em? Where’s he gone 
— was he chasin’ them?” 

“He ...” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic 
and the smoke. “Hagrid, he killed ...” 

“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. 
“Snape killed? What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?” 

“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed ... 
Dumbledore.” 

Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that 
could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending. 

“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?” 

“He’s dead. Snape killed him. ...” 



Page | 681 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill 
Dumbledore — don’ be stupid, Harry. Wha’s made 
yeh say tha’?” 

“I saw it happen.” 

“Yeh couldn’ have.” 

“I saw it, Hagrid.” 

Hagrid shook his head; his expression was 
disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that 
Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, 
that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a 
jinx. ... 

“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told 
Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said 
confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his cover. 

Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, 
Harry. ...” 

Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still 
shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon 
enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back 
toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its 
windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the 
scenes inside as people moved from room to room, 
telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that 
the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody 
must have been killed. ... 

The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light 
flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, 
uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping 
down the steps, looking around nervously for some 
sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. 
Harry’s eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at 
the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he 
Page | 682 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass 
there, though he was really too far away to see 
anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at 
the place where he thought Dumbledore ’s body must 
lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward 
it. 

“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said Hagrid, as he and 
Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as 
close as he could to their ankles. “Wha’s tha’, lyin’ on 
the grass?” Hagrid added sharply, heading now 
toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a 
small crowd was congregating. “See it, Harry? Righ’ at 
the foot o’ the tower? Under where the Mark ... Blimey 
... yeh don’ think someone got thrown — ?” 

Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible 
to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling 
the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the 
various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, 
though in an oddly detached way, as though 
somebody near him was suffering them. What was 
real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in 
his chest. ... 

He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the 
murmuring crowd to the very front, where the 
dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap. 

Harry heard Hagrid ’s moan of pain and shock, but he 
did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he 
reached the place where Dumbledore lay and 
crouched down beside him. He had known there was 
no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind 
Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, 
known that it could have happened only because its 
caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for 
seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest 
wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet. 

Page | 683 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore’s eyes were closed; but for the strange 
angle of his arms and legs, he might have been 
sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half- 
moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a 
trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. 
Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to 
absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: 
that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, 
never again could he help. ... 

The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what 
seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was 
kneeling upon something hard and looked down. 

The locket they had managed to steal so many hours 
before had fallen out of Dumbledore’s pocket. It had 
opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the 
ground. And although he could not feel more shock or 
horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, 
as he picked it up, that there was something wrong. 



He turned the locket over in his hands. This was 
neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing 
in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, 
no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be 
Slytherin’s mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside 
but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly 
into the place where a portrait should have been. 

Automatically, without really thinking about what he 
was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of 
parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the 
many wands that had now been lit behind him: 

To the Dark Lord 

I know I will be dead long before you read this 



Page | 684 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




but I want you to know that it was I who discovered 
your secret 

I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it 
as soon as I can. 

I face death in the hope that when you meet your 
match, 

you will be mortal once more. 

R.A.B. 

Harry neither knew nor cared what the message 
meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a 
Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by 
drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry 
crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes 
burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl. 



Page | 685 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




z? 




THE PHOENIX LAMENT 

“C’mere, Harry ...” 

“No.” 

“Yeh can’ stay here, Harry. ... Come on, now. ...” 

“No.” 

He did not want to leave Dumbledore’s side, he did 
not want to move anywhere. Hagrid’s hand on his 
shoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, 
“Harry, come on.” 

A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his 
and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure 
without really thinking about it. Only as he walked 
blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a 
trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny 
who was leading him back into the castle. 
Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and 
shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and 
Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance 
Page | 686 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry’s vision, 
people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, 
and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops 
of blood as they made their way toward the marble 
staircase. 

“We’re going to the hospital wing,” said Ginny. 

“I’m not hurt,” said Harry. 

“It’s McGonagall’s orders,” said Ginny. “Everyone’s up 
there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone — ” 

Fear stirred in Harry’s chest again: He had forgotten 
the inert figures he had left behind. 

“Ginny, who else is dead?” 

“Don’t worry, none of us.” 

“But the Dark Mark — Malfoy said he stepped over a 
body — ” 

“He stepped over Bill, but it’s all right, he’s alive.” 

There was something in her voice, however, that 
Harry knew boded ill. 

“Are you sure?” 

“Of course I’m sure ... he’s a — a bit of a mess, that’s 
all. Greyback attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he 
won’t — won’t look the same anymore. ...” 

Ginny ’s voice trembled a little. 

“We don’t really know what the aftereffects will be — I 
mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not 
transformed at the time.” 

Page | 687 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But the others . . . There were other bodies on the 
ground. ...” 

“Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but 
Madam Pomfrey says they’ll be all right. And a Death 
Eater’s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge 
blond one was firing off everywhere — Harry, if we 
hadn’t had your Felix potion, I think we’d all have 
been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us — ” 

They had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open 
the doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, 
in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, 
and Lupin were gathered around another bed near 
the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors 
opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry 
and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking 
anxious. 

“Are you all right, Harry?” 

“I’m fine. ... How’s Bill?” 

Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione’s 
shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on 
Bill’s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he 
looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his 
wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. 
Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoy’s 
Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand. 

“Can’t you fix them with a charm or something?” he 
asked the matron. 

“No charm will work on these,” said Madam Pomfrey. 
“I’ve tried everything I know, but there is no cure for 
werewolf bites.” 



Page | 688 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But he wasn’t bitten at the full moon,” said Ron, who 
was gazing down into his brother’s face as though he 
could somehow force him to mend just by staring. 
“Greyback hadn’t transformed, so surely Bill won’t be 
a — a real — ?” 

He looked uncertainly at Lupin. 

“No, I don’t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,” 
said Lupin, “but that does not mean that there won’t 
be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. 
They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and — and Bill 
might have some wolfish characteristics from now 
on.” 

“Dumbledore might know something that’d work, 
though,” Ron said. “Where is he? Bill fought those 
maniacs on Dumbledore’s orders, Dumbledore owes 
him, he can’t leave him in this state — ” 

“Ron — Dumbledore’s dead,” said Ginny. 

“No!” Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as 
though hoping the latter might contradict her, but 
when Harry did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair 
beside Bill’s bed, his hands over his face. Harry had 
never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though 
he was intruding upon something private, indecent. 

He turned away and caught Ron’s eye instead, 
exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what 
Ginny had said. 

“How did he die?” whispered Tonks. “How did it 
happen?” 

“Snape killed him,” said Harry. “I was there, I saw it. 
We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because 
that’s where the Mark was. ... Dumbledore was ill, he 
was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when 

Page | 689 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He 
immobilized me, I couldn’t do anything, I was under 
the Invisibility Cloak — and then Malfoy came 
through the door and disarmed him — ” 

Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron 
groaned. Luna’s mouth trembled. 

“ — more Death Eaters arrived — and then Snape — 
and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.” Harry couldn’t 
go on. 

Madam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her 
any attention except Ginny, who whispered, “Shh! 
Listen!” 

Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her 
mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the 
darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had 
never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible 
beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix 
song before, that the music was inside him, not 
without: It was his own grief turned magically to song 
that echoed across the grounds and through the 
castle windows. 

How long they all stood there, listening, he did not 
know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to 
listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a 
long time later that the hospital door opened again 
and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all 
the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There 
were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped. 

“Molly and Arthur are on their way,” she said, and the 
spell of the music was broken: Everyone roused 
themselves as though coming out of trances, turning 
again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyes, 
shake their heads. “Harry, what happened? According 
Page | 690 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when 
he — when it happened. He says Professor Snape was 
involved in some — ” 

“Snape killed Dumbledore,” said Harry. 

She stared at him for a moment, then swayed 
alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have 
pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair 
from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall. 

“Snape,” repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the 
chair. “We all wondered ... but he trusted ... always ... 
Snape ... I can’t believe it. ...” 

“Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,” said 
Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. “We 
always knew that.” 

“But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!” 
whispered Tonks. “I always thought Dumbledore 
must know something about Snape that we didn’t. ...” 

“He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for 
trusting Snape,” muttered Professor McGonagall, now 
dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a 
tartan- edged handkerchief. “I mean ... with Snape ’s 
history ... of course people were bound to wonder . . . 
but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape ’s 
repentance was absolutely genuine. ... Wouldn’t hear 
a word against him!” 

“I’d love to know what Snape told him to convince 
him,” said Tonks. 

“I know,” said Harry, and they all turned to look at 
him. “Snape passed Voldemort the information that 
made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then 
Snape told Dumbledore he hadn’t realized what he 

Page | 691 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




was doing, he was really sorry he’d done it, sorry that 
they were dead.” 

They all stared at him. 

“And Dumbledore believed that?” said Lupin 
incredulously. “Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry 
James was dead? Snape hated James. ...” 

“And he didn’t think my mother was worth a damn 
either,” said Harry, “because she was Muggle-born. ... 
‘Mudblood,’ he called her. ...” 

Nobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them 
seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest 
the monstrous truth of what had happened. 

“This is all my fault,” said Professor McGonagall 
suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet 
handkerchief in her hands. “My fault. I sent Filius to 
fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come 
and help us! If I hadn’t alerted Snape to what was 
going on, he might never have joined forces with the 
Death Eaters. I don’t think he knew they were there 
before Filius told him, I don’t think he knew they were 
coming.” 

“It isn’t your fault, Minerva,” said Lupin firmly. “We 
all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape 
was on his way. ...” 

“So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the 
Death Eaters’ side?” asked Harry, who wanted every 
detail of Snape ’s duplicity and infamy, feverishly 
collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear 
vengeance. 

“I don’t know exactly how it happened,” said Professor 
McGonagall distractedly. “It’s all so confusing. ...

Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the 
school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the 
corridors just in case ... Remus, Bill, and 
Nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled. 

All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the 
school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. 
There were powerful enchantments on every entrance 
into the castle. I still don’t know how the Death 
Eaters can possibly have entered. ...” 

“I do,” said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the 
pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway 
they formed. “So they got in through the Room of 
Requirement.” 

Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to 
Hermione, both of whom looked devastated. 

“I messed up, Harry,” said Ron bleakly. “We did like 
you told us: We checked the Marauder’s Map and we 
couldn’t see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in 
the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville 
went to keep watch on it ... but Malfoy got past us.” 

“He came out of the room about an hour after we 
started keeping watch,” said Ginny. “He was on his 
own, clutching that awful shriveled arm — ” 

“His Hand of Glory,” said Ron. “Gives light only to the 
holder, remember?” 

“Anyway,” Ginny went on, “he must have been 
checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death 
Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw 
something into the air and it all went pitch-black — ” 

“ — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said Ron 
bitterly. “Fred and George’s. I’m going to be having a 



Page | 693 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




word with them about who they let buy their 
products.” 

“We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,” said Ginny. 
“Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could 
do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and 
meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. 
Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand 
thing and was guiding them, but we didn’t dare use 
any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and 
by the time we’d reached a corridor that was light, 
they’d gone.” 

“Luckily,” said Lupin hoarsely, “Ron, Ginny, and 
Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us 
what had happened. We found the Death Eaters 
minutes later, heading in the direction of the 
Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn’t expected 
more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have 
exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any 
rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave 
chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed 
up the tower stairs — ” 

“To set off the Mark?” asked Harry. 

“He must have done, yes, they must have arranged 
that before they left the Room of Requirement,” said 
Lupin. “But I don’t think Gibbon liked the idea of 
waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he 
came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and 
was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.” 

“So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement 
with Ginny and Neville,” said Harry, turning to 
Hermione, “were you — ?” 

“Outside Snape’s office, yes,” whispered Hermione, 
her eyes sparkling with tears, “with Luna. We hung 

Page | 694 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




around for ages outside it and nothing happened. ... 
We didn’t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had 
taken the map. ... It was nearly midnight when 
Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the 
dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in 
the castle, I don’t think he really registered that Luna 
and I were there at all, he just burst his way into 
Snape’s office and we heard him saying that Snape 
had to go back with him and help and then we heard 
a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his 
room and he saw us and — and — ” 

“What?” Harry urged her. 

“I was so stupid, Harry!” said Hermione in a high- 
pitched whisper. “He said Professor Flitwick had 
collapsed and that we should go and take care of him 
while he — while he went to help fight the Death 
Eaters — ” She covered her face in shame and 
continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice 
was muffled. “We went into his office to see if we 
could help Professor Flitwick and found him 
unconscious on the floor ... and oh, it’s so obvious 
now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we 
didn’t realize, Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let 
Snape go!” 

“It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly. “Hermione, 
had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he 
probably would have killed you and Luna.” 

“So then he came upstairs,” said Harry, who was 
watching Snape running up the marble staircase in 
his mind’s eye, his black robes billowing behind him 
as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he 
ascended, “and he found the place where you were all 
fighting. ...” 



Page | 695 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“We were in trouble, we were losing,” said Tonks in a 
low voice. “Gibbon was down, but the rest of the 
Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. 
Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by 
Greyback ... It was all dark . . . curses flying 
everywhere ... The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must 
have slipped past, up the stairs ... then more of them 
ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair 
behind them with some kind of curse. ... Neville ran 
at it and got thrown up into the air — ” 

“None of us could break through,” said Ron, “and that 
massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over 
the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely 
missing us. ...” 

“And then Snape was there,” said Tonks, “and then 
he wasn’t — ” 

“I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death 
Eater’s jinx just missed me right afterward and I 
ducked and lost track of things,” said Ginny. 

“I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as 
though it wasn’t there,” said Lupin. “I tried to follow 
him, but was thrown back just like Neville. ...” 

“He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered 
McGonagall. “After all — he was the Defense Against 
the Dark Arts teacher. ... I just assumed that he was 
in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who’d 
escaped up to the tower. ...” 

“He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not 
to stop them ... and I’ll bet you had to have a Dark 
Mark to get through that barrier — so what happened 
when he came back down?” 



Page | 696 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that 
caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the 
curse blocking the stairs,” said Lupin. “We all ran 
forward — those of us who were still standing anyway 
— and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the 
dust — obviously, none of us attacked them — ” 

“We just let them pass,” said Tonks in a hollow voice. 
“We thought they were being chased by the Death 
Eaters — and next thing, the other Death Eaters and 
Greyback were back and we were fighting again — I 
thought I heard Snape shout something, but I don’t 
know what — ” 

“He shouted, ‘It’s over,’ ” said Harry. “He’d done what 
he’d meant to do.” 

They all fell silent. Fawkes’s lament was still echoing 
over the dark grounds outside. As the music 
reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome 
thoughts slunk into Harry’s mind. ... Had they taken 
Dumbledore’s body from the foot of the tower yet? 
What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? 
He clenched his fists tightly in his pockets. He could 
feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against 
the knuckles of his right hand. 

The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making 
them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up 
the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face 
terrified. 

“Molly — Arthur — ” said Professor McGonagall, 
jumping up and hurrying to greet them. “I am so 
sorry — ” 

“Bill,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor 
McGonagall as she caught sight of Bill’s mangled face. 
“Oh, Bill'.” 

Page | 697 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so 
that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the 
bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her 
lips to his bloody forehead. 

“You said Greyback attacked him?” Mr. Weasley 
asked Professor McGonagall distractedly. “But he 
hadn’t transformed? So what does that mean? What 
will happen to Bill?” 

“We don’t yet know,” said Professor McGonagall, 
looking helplessly at Lupin. 

“There will probably be some contamination, Arthur,” 
said Lupin. “It is an odd case, possibly unique. ... We 
don’t know what his behavior might be like when he 
awakens. ...” 

Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from 
Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bill’s wounds. 

“And Dumbledore ...” said Mr. Weasley. “Minerva, is it 
true ... Is he really ... ?” 

As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny 
move beside him and looked at her. Her slightly 
narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing 
down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face. 

“Dumbledore gone,” whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. 
Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son; she began 
to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated face. 

“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. ... It’s not 
r-really important . . . but he was a very handsome 
little b-boy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was g- 
going to be married!” 



Page | 698 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly 
and loudly. “What do you mean, ‘’e was going to be 
married?’ ” 

Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking 
startled. “Well — only that — ” 

“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” 
demanded Fleur. “You theenk, because of these bites, 
he will not love me?” 

“No, that’s not what I — ” 

“Because ’e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her 
full height and throwing back her long mane of silver 
hair. “It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill 
loving me!” 

“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I 
thought perhaps — given how — how he — ” 

“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or 
per’aps, you hoped?” said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. 
“What do I care how he looks? I am good-looking 
enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show 
is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!” she 
added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and 
snatching the ointment from her. 

Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and 
watched Fleur mopping up Bill’s wounds with a most 
curious expression upon her face. Nobody said 
anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody 
else, he was waiting for the explosion. 

“Our Great-Auntie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley after a 
long pause, “has a very beautiful tiara — goblin-made 
— which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you 



Page | 699 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, 
and it would look lovely with your hair.” 



“Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be 
lovely.” 

And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, 
both women were crying and hugging each other. 
Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world 
had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as 
stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were 
exchanging startled looks. 

“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at 
Lupin. “She still wants to marry him, even though 
he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!” 

“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and 
looking suddenly tense. “Bill will not be a full 
werewolf. The cases are completely — ” 

“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, 
seizing the front of Lupin’s robes and shaking them. 
“I’ve told you a million times. ...” 

And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse- 
colored hair, and the reason she had come running to 
find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor 
someone had been attacked by Greyback, all 
suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been 
Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all. 

“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, 
refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I 
am too old for you, too poor ... too dangerous. ...” 

“I’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on 
this, Remus,” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur’s shoulder 
as she patted her on the back. 

Page | 700 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I am not being ridiculous,” said Lupin steadily. 
“Tonks deserves somebody young and whole.” 

“But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small 
smile. “And after all, Remus, young and whole men do 
not necessarily remain so.” 

He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them. 

“This is ... not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, 
avoiding everybody’s eyes as he looked around 
distractedly. “Dumbledore is dead. ...” 

“Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody 
to think that there was a little more love in the world,” 
said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital 
doors opened again and Hagrid walked in. 

The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or 
beard was soaking and swollen; he was shaking with 
tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his hand. 

“I’ve ... I’ve done it, Professor,” he choked. “M-moved 
him. Professor Sprout’s got the kids back in bed. 
Professor Flitwick’s lyin’ down, but he says he’ll be all 
righ’ in a jiffy, an’ Professor Slughorn says the 
Ministry’s bin informed.” 

“Thank you, Hagrid,” said Professor McGonagall, 
standing up at once and turning to look at the group 
around Bill’s bed. “I shall have to see the Ministry 
when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of 
Houses — Slughorn can represent Slytherin — that I 
want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like 
you to join us too.” 

As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the 
room again, she looked down at Harry. “Before I meet 



Page | 701 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If 
you’ll come with me. ...” 

Harry stood up, murmured “See you in a bit” to Ron, 
Hermione, and Ginny, and followed Professor 
McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors 
outside were deserted and the only sound was the 
distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before 
Harry became aware that they were not heading for 
Professor McGonagall’s office, but for Dumbledore’s, 
and another few seconds before he realized that of 
course, she had been deputy headmistress. ... 
Apparently she was now headmistress ... so the room 
behind the gargoyle was now hers. 

In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase 
and entered the circular office. He did not know what 
he had expected: that the room would be draped in 
black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledore’s body 
might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly 
as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it 
mere hours previously: the silver instruments 
whirring and puffing on their spindle-legged tables, 
Gryffindor’s sword in its glass case gleaming in the 
moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the 
desk. But Fawkes’s perch stood empty, he was still 
crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait 
had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and 
headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was 
slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half- 
moon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose, 
looking peaceful and untroubled. 

After glancing once at this portrait, Professor 
McGonagall made an odd movement as though 
steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at 
Harry, her face taut and lined. 



Page | 702 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry,” she said, “I would like to know what you and 
Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when 
you left the school.” 

“I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said Harry. He had 
expected the question and had his answer ready. It 
had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore 
had told him that he was to confide the contents of 
their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione. 

“Harry, it might be important,” said Professor 
McGonagall. 

“It is,” said Harry, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell 
anyone.” 

Professor McGonagall glared at him. “Potter” — Harry 
registered the renewed use of his surname — “in the 
light of Professor Dumbledore’s death, I think you 
must see that the situation has changed somewhat — 



“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging. “Professor 
Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders 
if he died.” 

“But — ” 

“There’s one thing you should know before the 
Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmerta’s under 
the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the 
Death Eaters, that’s how the necklace and the 
poisoned mead — ” 

“Rosmerta?” said Professor McGonagall incredulously, 
but before she could go on, there was a knock on the 
door behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, 
and Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by 



Page | 703 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his huge 
frame trembling with grief. 

“Snape!” ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most 
shaken, pale and sweating. “Snape! I taught him! I 
thought I knew him!” 

But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp 
voice spoke from high on the wall: A sallow-faced 
wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back 
into his empty canvas. 

“Minerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he 
has just Disapparated from the Ministry.” 

“Thank you, Everard,” said Professor McGonagall, 
and she turned quickly to her teachers. 

“I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts 
before he gets here,” she said quickly. “Personally, I 
am not convinced that the school should reopen next 
year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one 
of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts ’s 
history. It is horrible.” 

“I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school 
to remain open,” said Professor Sprout. “I feel that if a 
single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to 
remain open for that pupil.” 

“But will we have a single pupil after this?” said 
Slughorn, now dabbing his sweating brow with a 
silken handkerchief. “Parents will want to keep their 
children at home and I can’t say I blame them. 
Personally, I don’t think we’re in more danger at 
Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can’t 
expect mothers to think like that. They’ll want to keep 
their families together, it’s only natural.” 



Page | 704 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I agree,” said Professor McGonagall. “And in any 
case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never 
envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. 
When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered 
the closure of the school — and I must say that 
Professor Dumbledore’s murder is more disturbing to 
me than the idea of Slytherin’s monster living 
undetected in the bowels of the castle. ...” 

“We must consult the governors,” said Professor 
Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large 
bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise 
unscathed by his collapse in Snape’s office. “We must 
follow the established procedures. A decision should 
not be made hastily.” 

“Hagrid, you haven’t said anything,” said Professor 
McGonagall. “What are your views, ought Hogwarts to 
remain open?” 

Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, 
spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, 
now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I dunno, 
Professor ... that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the 
headmistress ter decide ...” 

“Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,” 
said Professor McGonagall kindly, “and so do I.” 

“Well, I’m stayin’,” said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking 
out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into 
his tangled beard. “It’s me home, it’s bin me home 
since I was thirteen. An’ if there’s kids who wan’ me 
ter teach ’em, I’ll do it. But ... I dunno ... Hogwarts 
without Dumbledore ...” He gulped and disappeared 
behind his handkerchief once more, and there was 
silence. 



Page | 705 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out 
of the window at the grounds, checking to see 
whether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I 
must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to 
consult the governors, who will make the final 
decision. 

“Now, as to getting students home ... there is an 
argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We 
could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come 
tomorrow if necessary — ” 

“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, 
speaking at last. 

“Well ...” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of 
her briskness as her voice shook. “I — I know that it 
was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest here, at 
Hogwarts — ” 

“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry 
fiercely. 

“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor 
McGonagall. “No other headmaster or headmistress 
has ever been — ” 

“No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more 
to this school,” growled Hagrid. 

“Hogwarts should be Dumbledore’s final resting 
place,” said Professor Flitwick. 

“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout. 

“And in that case,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t send 
the students home until the funeral’s over. They’ll 
want to say — ” 



Page | 706 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The last word caught in his throat, but Professor 
Sprout completed the sentence for him. 



“Good-bye.” 

“Well said,” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “Well said 
indeed! Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting. 
We can arrange transport home afterward.” 

“Seconded,” barked Professor Sprout. 

“I suppose ... yes ...” said Slughorn in a rather 
agitated voice, while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of 
assent. 

“He’s coming,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly, 
gazing down into the grounds. “The Minister ... and 
by the looks of it, he’s brought a delegation ...” 

“Can I leave, Professor?” said Harry at once. 

He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, 
Rufus Scrimgeour tonight. 

“You may,” said Professor McGonagall. “And quickly.” 

She strode toward the door and held it open for him. 
He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the 
deserted corridor; he had left his Invisibility Cloak at 
the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; 
there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, 
not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did not 
meet another soul until he turned into the passage 
leading to the Gryffindor common room. 

“Is it true?” whispered the Fat Lady as he approached 
her. “It is really true? Dumbledore — dead?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

Page | 707 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She let out a wail and, without waiting for the 
password, swung forward to admit him. 



As Harry had suspected it would be, the common 
room was jam-packed. The room fell silent as he 
climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and 
Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that 
the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without 
speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at 
all, Harry walked straight across the room and 
through the door to the boys’ dormitories. 

As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully 
dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his 
own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared 
at each other. 

“They’re talking about closing the school,” said Harry. 
“Lupin said they would,” said Ron. 

There was a pause. 

“So?” said Ron in a very low voice, as though he 
thought the furniture might be listening in. “Did you 
find one? Did you get it? A — a Horcrux?” 

Harry shook his head. All that had taken place 
around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare 
now; had it really happened, and only hours ago? 

“You didn’t get it?” said Ron, looking crestfallen. “It 
wasn’t there?” 

“No,” said Harry. “Someone had already taken it and 
left a fake in its place.” 

“Already taken — ?” 

Page | 708 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his 
pocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story 
could wait. ... It did not matter tonight ... nothing 
mattered except the end, the end of their pointless 
adventure, the end of Dumbledore’s life. ... 

“R.A.B.,” whispered Ron, “but who was that?” 

“Dunno,” said Harry, lying back on his bed fully 
clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no 
curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he 
would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he 
became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. 
Fawkes had stopped singing. 

And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that 
the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just 
as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world 
. . . had left Harry.

THE WHITE TOMB 

All lessons were suspended, all examinations 
postponed. Some students were hurried away from 
Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of 
days — the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on 
the morning following Dumbledore’s death, and 
Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his 
haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the 
other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his 
mother home; they had a shouting match in the 
entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that 
he could remain behind for the funeral. She had 
difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told 
Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring 
into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to 
Dumbledore. 

Some excitement was caused among the younger 
students, who had never seen it before, when a 
powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a 
dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of 
the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and 



Page | 710 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



landed on the edge of the forest. Harry watched from 
a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, 
black-haired woman descended the carriage steps 
and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid’s arms. 
Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including 
the Minister of Magic himself, was being 
accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently 
avoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that, 
sooner or later, he would be asked again to account 
for Dumbledore’s last excursion from Hogwarts. 

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were spending all 
of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed 
to mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have 
been if Dumbledore had not died, and they had had 
this time together at the very end of the year, Ginny’s 
examinations finished, the pressure of homework 
lifted . . . and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing 
that he knew he must say, doing what he knew was 
right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best 
source of comfort. 

They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had 
been discharged, but Bill remained under Madam 
Pomfrey’s care. His scars were as bad as ever — in 
truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye 
Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs — 
but in personality he seemed just the same as ever. 

All that appeared to have changed was that he now 
had a great liking for very rare steaks. 

"... so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur 
happily, plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because ze 
British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said this.” 

“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he 
really is going to marry her,” sighed Ginny later that 
evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat beside 



Page | 711 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the open window of the Gryffindor common room, 
looking out over the twilit grounds. 

“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he 
added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she 
let out a reluctant giggle. 

“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.” 

“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, 
who was perusing the Evening Prophet. 

Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. 
“No,” she said reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. 
“They’re still looking for Snape but no sign ...” 

“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry 
every time this subject cropped up. “They won’t find 
Snape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as they’ve 
never managed to do that in all this time ...” 

“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t 
been sleeping that well since . . . well ... I could do with 
some sleep.” 

She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved 
at the other two, and departed for the girls’ 
dormitories. The moment the door had closed behind 
her, Hermione leaned forward toward Harry with a 
most Hermione-ish look on her face. 

“Harry, I found something out this morning, in the 
library.” 

“R.A.B.?” said Harry, sitting up straight. 

He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, 
excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a 
mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering 

Page | 712 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed 
before he could move a little farther along the dark 
and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path 
that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, 
and which he now knew he would have to journey 
alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes 
out there somewhere, and each would need to be 
found and eliminated before there was even a 
possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept 
reciting their names to himself, as though by listing 
them he could bring them within reach: the locket ... 
the cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s or 
Ravenclaw’s . . . the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . . 
something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s ... 

This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry’s mind as 
he fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with 
cups, lockets, and mysterious objects that he could 
not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered 
Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the 
moment he began to climb. ... 

He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket 
the morning after Dumbledore ’s death, and although 
she had not immediately recognized the initials as 
belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she 
had been reading, she had since been rushing off to 
the library a little more often than was strictly 
necessary for somebody who had no homework to do. 

“No,” she said sadly, “I’ve been trying, Harry, but I 
haven’t found anything. ... There are a couple of 
reasonably well-known wizards with those initials — 
Rosalind Antigone Bungs . . . Rupert ‘Axebanger’ 
Brookstanton ... but they don’t seem to fit at all. 
Judging by that note, the person who stole the 
Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can’t find a shred of 
evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything 



Page | 713 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




to do with him. ... No, actually, it’s about ... well, 
Snape.” 

She looked nervous even saying the name again. 

“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping 
back in his chair. 

“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half- 
Blood Prince business,” she said tentatively. 

“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d’you think I 
feel about that now?” 

“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said 
hastily, looking around to check that they were not 
being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about 
Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see ... she 
was Snape ’s mother!” 

“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. 
Hermione ignored him. 

“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and 
there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince 
marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later 
an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a 



“ — murderer,” spat Harry. 

“Well ... yes,” said Hermione. “So ... I was sort of 
right. Snape must have been proud of being ‘half a 
Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle from 
what it said in the Prophet” 

“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure- 
blood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and 
the rest of them. ... He’s just like Voldemort. Pure- 

Page | 714 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his 
parentage, trying to make himself feared using the 
Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name — 
Lord Voldemort — the Half-Blood Prince — how could 
Dumbledore have missed — ?” 

He broke off, looking out the window. He could not 
stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore ’s inexcusable 
trust in Snape ... but as Hermione had just 
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been 
taken in just the same. ... In spite of the increasing 
nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to 
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had 
helped him so much. ... 

Helped him ... it was an almost unendurable thought 
now. 

“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using 
that book,” said Ron. “He must’ve known where you 
were getting it all from.” 

“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used 
Sectumsempra. He didn’t really need Legilimency. ... 
He might even have known before then, with 
Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. 
... Shouldn’t have left his old book in the bottom of 
that cupboard, should he?” 

“But why didn’t he turn you in?” 

“I don’t think he wanted to associate himself with that 
book,” said Hermione. “I don’t think Dumbledore 
would have liked it very much if he’d known. And 
even if Snape pretended it hadn’t been his, Slughorn 
would have recognized his writing at once. Anyway, 
the book was left in Snape’s old classroom, and I’ll bet 
Dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘Prince.’ ” 



Page | 715 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I should’ve shown the book to Dumbledore,” said 
Harry. “All that time he was showing me how 
Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and I 
had proof Snape was too — ” 

“ ‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said Hermione quietly. 

“You were the one who kept telling me the book was 
dangerous!” 

“I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re putting too much 
blame on yourself. I thought the Prince seemed to 
have a nasty sense of humor, but I would never have 
guessed he was a potential killer. ...” 

“None of us could’ve guessed Snape would ... you 
know,” said Ron. 

Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their 
own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, 
were thinking about the following morning, when 
Dumbledore’s body would be laid to rest. He had 
never attended a funeral before; there had been no 
body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know 
what to expect and was a little worried about what he 
might see, about how he would feel. He wondered 
whether Dumbledore’s death would be more real to 
him once it was over. Though he had moments when 
the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, 
there were blank stretches of numbness where, 
despite the fact that nobody was talking about 
anything else in the whole castle, he still found it 
difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone. 
Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked 
desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that 
Dumbledore would come back. . . . He felt in his pocket 
for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now 
carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but 



Page | 716 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained 
still to do. 

Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts 
Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. 
Downstairs, he found the mood in the Great Hall 
subdued. Everybody was wearing their dress robes 
and no one seemed very hungry. Professor 
McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle 
of the staff table empty. Hagrid’s chair was deserted 
too; Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able 
to face breakfast, but Snape’s place had been 
unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry 
avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; 
Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour 
was looking for him. Among Scrimgeour’s entourage 
Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses 
of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware 
of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with 
unwonted venom. 

Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were 
muttering together. Hulking boys though they were, 
they looked oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of 
Malfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry 
had not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity 
was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in 
Malfoy’s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that he 
had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters 
arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have 
killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his 
infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest 
drop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry 
wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort 
making him do under threat of killing him and his 
parents? 

Harry’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the 
ribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to 

Page | 717 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




her feet, and the mournful hum in the Hall died away 
at once. 

“It is nearly time,” she said. “Please follow your Heads 
of Houses out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after 
me.” 

They filed out from behind their benches in near 
silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the 
Slytherin column, wearing magnificent, long, emerald 
green robes embroidered with silver. He had never 
seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, 
looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her 
hat, and when they reached the entrance hall, they 
found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a 
thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient 
black suit and tie reeking of mothballs. 

They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped 
out onto the stone steps from the front doors, toward 
the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as 
they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the 
place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in 
rows. An aisle ran down the center of them: There 
was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs 
facing it. It was the most beautiful summer’s day. 

An extraordinary assortment of people had already 
settled into half of the chairs; shabby and smart, old 
and young. Most Harry did not recognize, but a few 
he did, including members of the Order of the 
Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; 
Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest 
pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be 
holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported 
by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were 
wearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was 
Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs 
on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron 
Page | 718 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




in London; Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbor; the 
hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird 
Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam 
Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some 
people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the 
barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed 
the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts 
were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, 
discernible only when they moved, shimmering 
insubstantially on the gleaming air. 

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at 
the end of a row beside the lake. People were 
whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in 
the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The 
crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of 
affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being 
helped into a seat by Luna. Neville and Luna alone of 
the D.A. had responded to Hermione ’s summons the 
night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew 
why: They were the ones who had missed the D.A. 
most . . . probably the ones who had checked their 
coins regularly in the hope that there would be 
another meeting. 

Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, 
his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler 
hat as usual; Harry next recognized Rita Skeeter, 
who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook 
clutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a 
worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing 
expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black 
velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls. At the sight 
of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a 
sentinel near the water’s edge, she gave a start and 
scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away. 

The staff was seated at last. Harry could see 
Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front 

Page | 719 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether 
Scrimgeour or any of these important people were 
really sorry that Dumbledore was dead. But then he 
heard music, strange, otherworldly music, and he 
forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for 
the source of it. He was not the only one: Many heads 
were turning, searching, a little alarmed. 

“In there,” whispered Ginny in Harry’s ear. 

And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, 
inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of 
the Inferi: a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange 
language he did not understand, their pallid faces 
rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. 
The music made the hair on Harry’s neck stand up, 
and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of 
loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild 
faces of the singers, he had the feeling that they, at 
least, were sorry for Dumbledore’s passing. Then 
Ginny nudged him again and he looked around. 

Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the 
chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming 
with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet 
spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to 
be Dumbledore’s body. A sharp pain rose in Harry’s 
throat at this sight: For a moment, the strange music 
and the knowledge that Dumbledore’s body was so 
close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron 
looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick 
and fast into both Ginny ’s and Hermione’s laps. 

They could not see clearly what was happening at the 
front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body 
carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the 
aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises 
that drew scandalized looks from some, including, 
Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge ... but Harry knew that 
Page | 720 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a 
friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid’s 
eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see 
where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to 
which Hagrid was heading and realized what was 
guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and 
trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the 
giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, 
docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his 
half-brother, and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the 
head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. 
Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But 
then the music stopped, and he turned to face the 
front again. 

A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got 
to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore ’s 
body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd 
words floated back to them over the hundreds of 
heads. “Nobility of spirit” ... “intellectual contribution” 
... “greatness of heart” ... It did not mean very much. 

It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had 
known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore ’s 
idea of a few words, “nitwit,” “oddment,” “blubber,” 
and “tweak,” and again had to suppress a grin. ... 
What was the matter with him? 

There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he 
saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to 
listen too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at 
the water’s edge two years ago, very close to where 
Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the 
Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore 
had learned Mermish. There was so much he had 
never asked him, so much he should have said. ... 

And then, without warning, it swept over him, the 
dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than 
it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone. ... He 

Page | 721 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it 
hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from 
his eyes: He looked away from Ginny and the others 
and stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the 
little man in black droned on. ... There was movement 
among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their 
respects too. They did not move into the open but 
Harry saw them standing quite still, half hidden in 
shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at 
their sides. And Harry remembered his first 
nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had 
ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, 
and how he had faced him, and how he and 
Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not 
long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to 
fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then 
could evil be kept at bay, though never quite 
eradicated. ... 

And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the 
hot sun how people who cared about him had stood 
in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his 
godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to 
protect him; but now that was over. He could not let 
anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he 
must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have 
lost at the age of one, that the shelter of a parent’s 
arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was 
no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper 
in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in 
his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors 
had died, and he was more alone than he had ever 
been before. 

The little man in black had stopped speaking at last 
and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else 
to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably 
from the Minister, but nobody moved. 



Page | 722 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames 
had erupted around Dumbledore’s body and the table 
upon which it lay: Higher and higher they rose, 
obscuring the body. White smoke spiraled into the air 
and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one 
heart- stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly 
joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had 
vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, 
encasing Dumbledore’s body and the table on which 
he had rested. 

There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of 
arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short 
of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs’ 
tribute: He saw them turn tail and disappear back 
into the cool trees. Likewise, the merpeople sank 
slowly back into the green water and were lost from 
view. 

Harry looked at Ginny, Ron, and Hermione: Ron’s 
face was screwed up as though the sunlight were 
blinding him. Hermione ’s face was glazed with tears, 
but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry’s gaze 
with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen 
when she had hugged him after winning the 
Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at 
that moment they understood each other perfectly, 
and that when he told her what he was going to do 
now, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” 
but accept his decision, because she would not have 
expected anything less of him. And so he steeled 
himself to say what he had known he must say ever 
since Dumbledore had died. 

“Ginny, listen ...” he said very quietly, as the buzz of 
conversation grew louder around them and people 
began to get to their feet, “I can’t be involved with you 
anymore. We’ve got to stop seeing each other. We 
can’t be together.” 

Page | 723 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She said, with an oddly twisted smile, “It’s for some 
stupid, noble reason, isn’t it?” 

“It’s been like ... like something out of someone else’s 
life, these last few weeks with you,” said Harry. “But I 
can’t ... we can’t ... I’ve got things to do alone now.” 

She did not cry, she simply looked at him. 

“Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He’s 
already used you as bait once, and that was just 
because you’re my best friend’s sister. Think how 
much danger you’ll be in if we keep this up. He’ll 
know, hell find out. He’ll try and get to me through 
you.” 

“What if I don’t care?” said Ginny fiercely. 

“I care,” said Harry. “How do you think I’d feel if this 
was your funeral ... and it was my fault. ...” 

She looked away from him, over the lake. 

“I never really gave up on you,” she said. “Not really. I 
always hoped. ... Hermione told me to get on with life, 
maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit 
around you, because I never used to be able to talk if 
you were in the room, remember? And she thought 
you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more — 
myself.” 

“Smart girl, that Hermione,” said Harry, trying to 
smile. “I just wish I’d asked you sooner. We could’ve 
had ages ... months ... years maybe. ...” 

“But you’ve been too busy saving the Wizarding 
world,” said Ginny, half laughing. “Well ... I can’t say 
I’m surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I 



Page | 724 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




knew you wouldn’t be happy unless you were hunting 
Voldemort. Maybe that’s why I like you so much.” 

Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he 
think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting 
beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione 
and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his 
shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long 
nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned 
his back on Ginny and on Dumbledore’s tomb, and 
walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more 
bearable than sitting still, just as setting out as soon 
as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill 
Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it. ... 

“Harry!” 

He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly 
toward him around the bank, leaning on his walking 
stick. 

“I’ve been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I 
walk a little way with you?” 

“No,” said Harry indifferently, and set off again. 

“Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,” said Scrimgeour 
quietly. “I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear 
of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our 
disagreements, as you know, but no one knows better 
than I — ” 

“What do you want?” asked Harry flatly. 

Scrimgeour looked annoyed, but as before, hastily 
modified his expression to one of sorrowful 
understanding. 



Page | 725 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You are, of course, devastated,” he said. “I know that 
you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may 
have been his favorite pupil ever. The bond between 
the two of you — ” 

“What do you want?” Harry repeated, coming to a 
halt. 

Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and 
stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now. 

“The word is that you were with him when he left the 
school the night that he died.” 

“Whose word?” said Harry. 

“Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the 
tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two 
broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and 
two, Harry.” 

“Glad to hear it,” said Harry. “Well, where I went with 
Dumbledore and what we did is my business. He 
didn’t want people to know.” 

“Such loyalty is admirable, of course,” said 
Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his 
irritation with difficulty, “but Dumbledore is gone, 
Harry. He’s gone.” 

“He will only be gone from the school when none here 
are loyal to him,” said Harry, smiling in spite of 
himself. 

“My dear boy . . . even Dumbledore cannot return from 
the — ” 

“I am not saying he can. You wouldn’t understand. 

But I’ve got nothing to tell you.” 

Page | 726 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was 
evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy, “The 
Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you 
know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of 
my Aurors at your service — ” 

Harry laughed. “Voldemort wants to kill me himself, 
and Aurors won’t stop him. So thanks for the offer, 
but no thanks.” 

“So,” said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, “the 
request I made of you at Christmas — ” 

“What request? Oh yeah . . . the one where I tell the 
world what a great job you’re doing in exchange for — ” 

“ — for raising everyone’s morale!” snapped 
Scrimgeour. 

Harry considered him for a moment. 

“Released Stan Shunpike yet?” 

Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly 
reminiscent of Uncle Vernon. 

“I see you are — ” 

“Dumbledore’s man through and through,” said 
Harry. “That’s right.” 

Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then 
turned and limped away without another word. Harry 
could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation 
waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the 
sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their 
seats. Ron and Hermione were hurrying toward 
Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite 
direction. Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting 
Page | 727 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




for them to catch up, which they finally did in the 
shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in 
happier times. 

“What did Scrimgeour want?” Hermione whispered. 

“Same as he wanted at Christmas,” shrugged Harry. 
“Wanted me to give him inside information on 
Dumbledore and be the Ministry’s new poster boy.” 

Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, 
then he said loudly to Hermione, “Look, let me go 
back and hit Percy!” 

“No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm. 

“It’ll make me feel better!” 

Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, 
though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle. 

“I can’t bear the idea that we might never come back,” 
she said softly. “How can Hogwarts close?” 

“Maybe it won’t,” said Ron. “We’re not in any more 
danger here than we are at home, are we? 
Everywhere’s the same now. I’d even say Hogwarts is 
safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the 
place. What d’you reckon, Harry?” 

“I’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said 
Harry. 

Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, “I knew 
you were going to say that. But then what will you 
do?” 



Page | 728 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm going back to the Dursleys’ once more, because 
Dumbledore wanted me to,” said Harry. “But it’ll be a 
short visit, and then I’ll be gone for good.” 

“But where will you go if you don’t come back to 
school?” 

“I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry 
muttered. He had had the idea in his head ever since 
the night of Dumbledore’s death. “For me, it started 
there, all of it. I’ve just got a feeling I need to go there. 
And I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.” 

“And then what?” said Ron. 

“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, 
haven’t I?” said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore’s 
white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of 
the lake. “That’s what he wanted me to do, that’s why 
he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right — 
and I’m sure he was — there are still four of them out 
there. I’ve got to find them and destroy them, and 
then I’ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort’s 
soul, the bit that’s still in his body, and I’m the one 
who’s going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape 
along the way,” he added, “so much the better for me, 
so much the worse for him.” 

There was a long silence. The crowd had almost 
dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental 
figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, 
whose howls of grief were still echoing across the 
water. 

“Well be there, Harry,” said Ron. 

“What?” 



Page | 729 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“At your aunt and uncle’s house,” said Ron. “And 
then well go with you wherever you’re going.” 

“No — ” said Harry quickly; he had not counted on 
this, he had meant them to understand that he was 
undertaking this most dangerous journey alone. 

“You said to us once before,” said Hermione quietly, 
“that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. 
We’ve had time, haven’t we? 

“We’re with you whatever happens,” said Ron. “But 
mate, you’re going to have to come round my mum 
and dad’s house before we do anything else, even 
Godric’s Hollow.” 

“Why?” 

“Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?” 

Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything 
as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed 
incredible and yet wonderful. 

“Yeah, we shouldn’t miss that,” he said finally. 

His hand closed automatically around the fake 
Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the 
dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for 
himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort 
he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, 
or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that 
there was still one last golden day of peace left to 
enjoy with Ron and Hermione.

I 



* 

THE DARK LORD ASCENDING 

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards 
apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they 
stood quite still, wands directed at each other’s 
chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed 
their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking 
briskly in the same direction. 

“News?” asked the taller of the two. 

“The best,” replied Severus Snape. 

The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low- 
growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly 
manicured hedge. The men’s long cloaks flapped 
around their ankles as they marched. 

“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt 
features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of 
overhanging trees broke the moonlight. “It was a little 
trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be 
satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will 
be good?” 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned 
right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The 
high hedge curved with them, running off into the 
distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron 
gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke 
step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of 
salute and passed straight through, as though the 
dark metal were smoke. 

The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s 
footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their 
right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his 
companion’s head, but the source of the noise proved 
to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, 
strutting majestically along the top of the hedge. 

“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks ...” 
Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a 
snort. 

A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at 
the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the 
diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in 
the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was 
playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape 
and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung 
inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly 
opened it. 

The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously 
decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of 
the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on 
the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode 
past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door 
leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of 
a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle. 

The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a 
long and ornate table. The room’s usual furniture had 

Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




been pushed carelessly up against the walls. 
Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a 
handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a 
gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a 
moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew 
accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn 
upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an 
apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside 
down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended 
by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in 
the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of 
the people seated underneath this singular sight was 
looking at it except for a pale young man sitting 
almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent 
himself from glancing upward every minute or so. 

“Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head 
of the table. “You are very nearly late.” 

The speaker was seated directly in front of the 
fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new 
arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they 
drew nearer, however, his face shone through the 
gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and 
gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was 
so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow. 

“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indicating the seat 
on his immediate right. “Yaxley — beside Dolohov.” 

The two men took their allotted places. Most of the 
eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to 
him that Voldemort spoke first. 

“So?” 

“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move 
Harry Potter from his current place of safety on 
Saturday next, at nightfall.” 

Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The interest around the table sharpened palpably: 
Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape 
and Voldemort. 

“Saturday ... at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His 
red eyes fastened upon Snape ’s black ones with such 
intensity that some of the watchers looked away, 
apparently fearful that they themselves would be 
scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, 
looked calmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a 
moment or two, Voldemort’s lipless mouth curved into 
something like a smile. 

“Good. Very good. And this information comes — ” 

“ — from the source we discussed,” said Snape. 

“My Lord.” 

Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table 
at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him. 

“My Lord, I have heard differently.” 

Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he 
went on, “Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will 
not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the 
boy turns seventeen.” 

Snape was smiling. 

“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false 
trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm 
has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the 
first time; he is known to be susceptible.” 

“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite 
certain,” said Yaxley. 



Page | 5 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” 
said Snape. “I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office 
will play no further part in the protection of Harry 
Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the 
Ministry.” 

“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a 
squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he 
gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there 
along the table. 

Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered 
upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he 
seemed to be lost in thought. 

“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an 
entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy 



Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley 
subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort 
turned back to Snape. 

“Where are they going to hide the boy next?” 

“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The 
place, according to the source, has been given every 
protection that the Order and Ministry together could 
provide. I think that there is little chance of taking 
him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the 
Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might 
give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough 
of the enchantments to break through the rest.” 

“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the 
firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. “Will the 
Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?” 



Page | 6 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his 
shoulders. 

“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have — 
with difficulty, and after great effort — suceeded in 
placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.” 

Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked 
impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, 
twisted face, clapped him on the back. 

“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only 
one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our 
people before I act. One failed attempt on the 
Minister’s life will set me back a long way.” 

“Yes — my Lord, that is true — but you know, as 
Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, 
Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the 
Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the 
other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy 
now that we have such a high-ranking official under 
our control, to subjugate the others, and then they 
can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.” 

“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered 
before he has converted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At 
any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be 
mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the 
boy at his destination, then it must be done while he 
travels.” 

“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, 
who seemed determined to receive some portion of 
approval. “We now have several people planted within 
the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter 
Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know 
immediately.” 



Page | 7 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is 
eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or 
regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to 
do with the place.” 

“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move 
in the open. Easier to take, by far.” 

Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving 
body as he went on, “I shall attend to the boy in 
person. There have been too many mistakes where 
Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been 
my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors 
than to his triumphs.” 

The company around the table watched Voldemort 
apprehensively, each of them, by his or her 
expression, afraid that they might be blamed for 
Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, 
however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than 
to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body 
above him. 

“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by 
luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best- 
laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those 
things that I did not understand before. I must be the 
one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.” 

At these words, seemingly in response to them, a 
sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of 
misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked 
downward, startled, for the sound had seemed to 
issue from below their feet. 

“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his 
quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes 
from the revolving body above, “have I not spoken to 
you about keeping our prisoner quiet?” 

Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down 
the table, who had been sitting so low in his chair 
that it had appeared, at first glance, to be 
unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and 
scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him 
but a curious gleam of silver. 

“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again 
at the tense faces of his followers, “I understand 
better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a 
wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.” 

The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; 
he might have announced that he wanted to borrow 
one of their arms. 

“No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see ... Lucius, 
I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.” 

Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish 
and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken 
and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. 

“My Lord?” 

“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.” 



Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring 
straight ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long 
blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the 
table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At 
her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, 
withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, 
who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it 
closely. 

“What is it?” 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy. 



“And the core?” 

“Dragon — dragon heartstring.” 

“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand 
and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an 
involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it 
seemed he expected to receive Voldemort’s wand in 
exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by 
Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously. 

“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?” 

Some of the throng sniggered. 

“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not 
enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your 
family seem less than happy of late. ... What is it 
about my presence in your home that displeases you, 
Lucius?” 

“Nothing — nothing, my Lord!” 

“Such lies, Lucius ...” 

The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel 
mouth had stopped moving. One or two of the wizards 
barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew 
louder; something heavy could be heard sliding 
across the floor beneath the table. 

The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up 
Voldemort’s chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, and 
came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck 
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their 
vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked 

Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the creature absently with long thin fingers, still 
looking at Lucius Malfoy. 

“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? 

Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they 
professed to desire for so many years?” 

“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand 
shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did 
desire it — we do.” 

To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her 
eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his 
right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the 
inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort 
and away again, terrified to make eye contact. 

“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the 
table, her voice constricted with emotion, “it is an 
honor to have you here, in our family’s house. There 
can be no higher pleasure.” 

She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with 
her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in 
bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and 
impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for 
mere words could not demonstrate her longing for 
closeness. 

“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head 
tilted a little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. 
“That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.” 

Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears 
of delight. 

“My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!” 



Page | 11 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy 
event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this 
week?” 



She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. 

“I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.” 

“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, 
Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married the 
werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.” 

There was an eruption of jeering laughter from 
around the table. Many leaned forward to exchange 
gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. 
The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its 
mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters 
did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and 
the Malfoys’ humiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently 
flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy 
red. 

“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the 
outpouring of mirth. “We — Narcissa and I — have 
never set eyes on our sister since she married the 
Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of 
us, nor any beast she marries.” 

“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though 
his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the 
catcalls and jeers. “Will you babysit the cubs?” 

The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at 
his father, who was staring down into his own lap, 
then caught his mother’s eye. She shook her head 
almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan 
stare at the opposite wall. 



Page | 12 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. 
“Enough.” 

And the laughter died at once. 

“Many of our oldest family trees become a little 
diseased over time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, 
breathless and imploring. “You must prune yours, 
must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those 
parts that threaten the health of the rest.” 

“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes 
swam with tears of gratitude again. “At the first 
chance!” 

“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your 
family, so in the world . . . we shall cut away the 
canker that infects us until only those of the true 
blood remain. ...” 

Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it 
directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over 
the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to 
life with a groan and began to struggle against 
invisible bonds. 

“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked 
Voldemort. 

Snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of 
the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, 
as though they had been given permission to show 
curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the 
woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, “Severus! 
Help me!” 

“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly 
away again. 



Page | 13 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the 
snake’s snout with his wand-free hand. Draco shook 
his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he 
seemed unable to look at her anymore. 

“But you would not have taken her classes,” said 
Voldemort. “For those of you who do not know, we are 
joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until 
recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry.” 

There were small noises of comprehension around the 
table. A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth 
cackled. 

“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of 
witches and wizards all about Muggles . . . how they 
are not so different from us ...” 

One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity 
Burbage revolved to face Snape again. 

“Severus ... please ... please ...” 

“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of 
Malfoy’s wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. 

“Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds 
of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage 
wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the 
Daily Prophet Wizards, she says, must accept these 
thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling 
of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most 
desirable circumstance. ... She would have us all 
mate with Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves. ...” 

Nobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking 
the anger and contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the 
third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. 
Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape 

Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned 
slowly away from him again. 

“Avada Kedavra.” 

The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the 
room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the 
table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of 
the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell 
out of his onto the floor. 

“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great 
snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto 
the polished wood.

IN MEMORIAM 

Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his 
left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered 
open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of 
breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea 
that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom 
door. 

“What the — ?” 

He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet 
Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was 
Dudley’s idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his 
bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments 
of cup together with the other hand and threw them 
into the already crammed bin just visible inside his 
bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the 
bathroom to run his finger under the tap. 

It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that 
he still had four days left of being unable to perform 
magic . . . but he had to admit to himself that this 
jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He 

Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 



had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he 
came to think of it — particularly in light of his 
immediate plans — this seemed a serious flaw in his 
magical education. Making a mental note to ask 
Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of 
toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, 
before returning to his bedroom and slamming the 
door behind him. 

Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his 
school trunk for the first time since he had packed it 
six years ago. At the start of the intervening school 
years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three 
quarters of the contents and replaced or updated 
them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom 
— old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that 
no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged 
his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain 
in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn 
it to see a lot of blood. 

He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling 
down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the 
bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that 
flickered feebly between Support CEDRIC DIGGORY 
and POTTER STINKS , a cracked and worn-out 
Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note 
signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered 
the sharp edge that had done the damage. He 
recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment 
of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, 
Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt 
cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing 
more remained of his godfather’s last gift except 
powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of 
debris like glittering grit. 

Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which 
he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright 

Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the 
fragment on top of that morning’s Daily Prophet, 
which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem 
the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of 
regret and of longing the discovery of the broken 
mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the 
rubbish in the trunk. 

It took another hour to empty it completely, throw 
away the useless items, and sort the remainder in 
piles according to whether or not he would need them 
from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, 
cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his 
textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He 
wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with 
them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if 
they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His 
Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, 
certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once 
given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been 
repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were 
the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the note 
signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this 
place of honor not because it was valuable — in all 
usual senses it was worthless — but because of what 
it had cost to attain it. 

This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his 
desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of 
the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this 
summer. 

He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to 
his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to 
flick through the newspapers, throwing them onto the 
rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep, or else 
faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited 
amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the 
moment. 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, 
Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue 
that he knew had arrived shortly after he had 
returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he 
remembered that there had been a small mention on 
the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, 
the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he 
found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk 
chair and reread the article he had been looking for. 

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED 

by Elphias Doge 

I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our 
first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was 
undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt 
ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon 
pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was 
no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and 
greenish hue did not encourage many to approach 
me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts 
under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a 
year previously, his father, Percival, had been 
convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon 
three young Muggles. 

Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who 
was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on 
the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he 
assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. 
Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad 
business, though many attempted to make him do so. 
Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father’s 
action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle- 
hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As 
anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never 
revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, 



Page | 19 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




his determined support for Muggle rights gained him 
many enemies in subsequent years. 

In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame 
had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of 
his first year he would never again be known as the 
son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less 
than the most brilliant student ever seen at the 
school. Those of us who were privileged to be his 
friends benefited from his example, not to mention his 
help and encouragement, with which he was always 
generous. He confessed to me in later life that he 
knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in 
teaching. 

He not only won every prize of note that the school 
offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with 
the most notable magical names of the day, including 
Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist ; Bathilda 
Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, 
the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found 
their way into learned publications such as 
Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and 
The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s future career 
seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question 
that remained was when he would become Minister of 
Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that 
he was on the point of taking the job, however, he 
never had Ministerial ambitions. 

Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus’s 
brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not 
alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, 
preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than 
through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite 
wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers 
were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as 
two such different boys could do. In fairness to 
Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus’s 
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable 
experience. Being continually outshone was an 
occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot 
have been any more pleasurable as a brother. 

When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take 
the then- traditional tour of the world together, visiting 
and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our 
separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the 
very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother, Kendra, died, 
leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the 
family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay 
my respects at Kendra’s funeral, then left for what 
was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger 
brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to 
them, there could no longer be any question of Albus 
accompanying me. 

That was the period of our lives when we had least 
contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps 
insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow 
escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments 
of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of 
his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly 
dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own 
experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward 
the end of my year’s travels, that yet another tragedy 
had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, 
Ariana. 

Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long 
time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their 
mother, had a profound effect on both of her 
brothers. All those closest to Albus — and I count 
myself one of that lucky number — agree that 
Ariana ’s death, and Albus’s feeling of personal 
responsibility for it (though, of course, he was 
guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore. 



Page | 21 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




I returned home to find a young man who had 
experienced a much older person’s suffering. Albus 
was more reserved than before, and much less light- 
hearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had 
led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and 
Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would 
lift — in later years they reestablished, if not a close 
relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However, 
he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then 
on, and his friends learned not to mention them. 

Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following 
years. Dumbledore’s innumerable contributions to the 
store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery 
of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, will benefit 
generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed 
in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of 
the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel 
ever matched that between Dumbledore and 
Grindelwald in 1 945. Those who witnessed it have 
written of the terror and the awe they felt as they 
watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. 
Dumbledore’s triumph, and its consequences for the 
Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in 
magical history to match the introduction of the 
International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He- 
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 

Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could 
find something to value in anyone, however 
apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe 
that his early losses endowed him with great 
humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship 
more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing 
compared to the Wizarding world’s. That he was the 
most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts 
headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he 
lived: working always for the greater good and, to his 
last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small 
Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met 
him. 

Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the 
picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was 
wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered 
over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the 
impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, 
whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. 

He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but 
ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to 
recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never 
once had he imagined Dumbledore ’s childhood or 
youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as 
Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired 
and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was 
simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione 
or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. 

He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his 
past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent 
even, but after all, it had been common knowledge 
that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary 
duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to 
ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about 
any of his other famous achievements. No, they had 
always discussed Harry, Harry’s past, Harry’s future, 
Harry’s plans ... and it seemed to Harry now, despite 
the fact that his future was so dangerous and so 
uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable 
opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore 
more about himself, even though the only personal 
question he had ever asked his headmaster was also 
the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not 
answered honestly: 

“ What do you see when you look in the mirror?” 



Page | 23 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“/? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” 

After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the 
obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and 
tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive 
Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he 
threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile 
and turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The 
only things left out of place were today’s Daily 
Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the 
piece of broken mirror. 

Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror 
fragment off today’s Prophet, and unfolded the 
newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline 
when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the 
delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, 
after noting that it said nothing about Voldemort. 
Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the 
Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was 
only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed. 

Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller 
headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore 
striding along looking harried: 

DUMBLEDORE — THE TRUTH AT LAST? 

Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed 
genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard 
of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of 
serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals 
the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the 
lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore 
carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be 
Minister of Magic content to remain a mere 
headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret 
organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? 

HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end? 

Page | 24 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The answers to these and many more questions are 
explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and 
Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively 
interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13, inside. 

Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. 
The article was topped with a picture showing 
another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled 
glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth 
bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning 
smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best 
to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on. 

In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer 
than her famously ferocious quill-portraits might 
suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, 
she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, 
a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a 
steaming vat of freshest gossip. 

“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” 
says Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m sure my book 
will be the first of very, very many.” 

Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine- 
hundred-page book was completed a mere four weeks 
after Dumbledore ’s mysterious death in June. I ask 
her how she managed this superfast feat. 

“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as I have, 
working to a deadline is second nature. I knew that 
the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story 
and I wanted to be the first to meet that need.” 

I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of 
Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and 
longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore’s, that 
“Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a Chocolate 
Frog card. ” 

Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Skeeter throws back her head and laughs. 



“Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few 
years back about merpeople rights, bless him. 
Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at 
the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to 
watch out for trout.” 

And yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy 
have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter really 
feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a 
full picture of Dumbledore’s long and extraordinary 
life? 

“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me 
affectionately across the knuckles, “you know as well 
as I do how much information can be generated by a 
fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word ‘no,’ 
and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were 
queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not 
everyone thought he was so wonderful, you know — 
he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old 
Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because 
I’ve had access to a source most journalists would 
swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in 
public before and who was close to Dumbledore 
during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of 
his youth.” 

The advance publicity for Skeeter’ s biography has 
certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store 
for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a 
blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she 
uncovered, I ask? 

“Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all the 
highlights before anybody’s bought the book!” laughs 
Skeeter. “But I can promise that anybody who still 
thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a 

Page | 26 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




rude awakening! Let’s just say that nobody hearing 
him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed 
that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! 
And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading 
for tolerance, he wasn’t exactly broad-minded when 
he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an 
extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy 
family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.” 

I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore ’s 
brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the 
Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor 
scandal fifteen years ago. 

“Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap, ” laughs 
Skeeter. “No, no, I’m talking about much worse than a 
brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, 
worse even than the Muggle-maiming father — 
Dumbledore couldn’t keep either of them quiet anyway, 
they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it’s the 
mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little 
digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness — but, 
as I say, you’ll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve 
for full details. All I can say now is, it’s no wonder 
Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got 
broken. ” 

Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny 
the brilliance that led to Dumbledore ’s many magical 
discoveries? 

“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many now 
question whether he could really take full credit for all 
of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter 
sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already 
discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when 
Dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.” 



Page | 27 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




But the importance of some of Dumbledore’s 
achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What of 
his famous defeat of Grindelwald? 

“Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,” says 
Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. “I’m afraid those who 
go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore’s spectacular victory 
must brace themselves for a bombshell — or perhaps 
a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I’ll say 
is, don’t be so sure that there really was the 
spectacular duel of legend. After they’ve read my 
book, people may be forced to conclude that 
Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief 
from the end of his wand and came quietly!” 

Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this 
intriguing subject, so we turn instead to the 
relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her 
readers more than any other. 

“Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote an 
entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore 
relationship. It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister. 
Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the 
whole story, but there is no question that 
Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from 
the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s best 
interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret 
that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.” 

I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry 
Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year: a 
breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively 
of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. 

“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. 
“Poor Potter has few real friends, and we met at one of 
the most testing moments of his life — the Triwizard 
Tournament. I am probably one of the only people 

Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




alive who can say that they know the real Harry 
Potter.” 

Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still 
circulating about Dumbledore’s final hours. Does 
Skeeter believe that Potter was there when 
Dumbledore died? 

“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the 
book — but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw 
Potter running away from the scene moments after 
Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later 
gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against 
whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it 
seems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide 
— once they’ve read my book.” 

On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be 
no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant 
bestseller. Dumbledore’s legions of admirers, 
meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to 
emerge about their hero. 

Harry reached the bottom of the article, but 
continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion and 
fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the 
newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, 
where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around 
his overflowing bin. 

He began to stride blindly around the room, opening 
empty drawers and picking up books only to replace 
them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he 
was doing, as random phrases from Rita’s article 
echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole 
Potter-Dumbledore relationship . . . It’s been called 
unhealthy, even sinister. . . . He dabbled in the Dark 
Arts himself in his youth . . . I’ve had access to a source 
most journalists would swap their wands for ... 

Page | 29 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Lies!” Harry bellowed, and through the window he 
saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to 
restart his lawn mower, look up nervously. 

Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of 
mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and 
turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of 
Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was 
defaming him. ... 

A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger 
slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. He 
had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over 
his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of 
Aunt Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue 
there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the 
mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own 
bright green eye looking back at him. 

He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; 
imagined it, because he had been thinking of his dead 
headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the 
bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never 
pierce him again.

THE DURSLEYS DEPARTING 

The sound of the front door slamming echoed up the 
stairs and a voice yelled, “Oi! You!” 

Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no 
doubt whom his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he 
did not immediately respond. He was still gazing at 
the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, he 
had thought he saw Dumbledore’s eye. It was not 
until his uncle bellowed, “BOY!” that Harry got slowly 
to his feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing 
to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack 
filled with things he would be taking with him. 

“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when 
Harry appeared at the top of the stairs. “Get down 
here, I want a word!” 

Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans 
pockets. When he reached the living room he found 
all three Dursleys. They were dressed for traveling: 
Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in 



Page | 31 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



a neat salmon-colored coat, and Dudley, Harry’s 
large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket. 



“Yes?” asked Harry. 

“Sit down!” said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his 
eyebrows. “Please!” added Uncle Vernon, wincing 
slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. 

Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His 
uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley following his movements with anxious 
expressions. Finally, his large purple face crumpled 
with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front of 
Harry and spoke. 

“I’ve changed my mind,” he said. 

“What a surprise,” said Harry. 

“Don’t you take that tone — ” began Aunt Petunia in a 
shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved her down. 

“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring 
at Harry with piggy little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t 
believe a word of it. We’re staying put, we’re not going 
anywhere.” 

Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of 
exasperation and amusement. Vernon Dursley had 
been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for 
the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and 
repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry’s 
favorite moment had been the one when Uncle 
Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his 
dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been 
unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the 
boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much 
swearing. 

Page | 32 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, 
resuming his pacing up and down the living room, 
“we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From 



— from — ” 



“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry. 

“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, 
coming to a halt in front of Harry again. “I was awake 
half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it’s a 
plot to get the house.” 

“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?” 

“ This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his 
forehead starting to pulse. “Our house! House prices 
are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the 
way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus 
and before we know it the deeds will be in your name 
and — ” 

“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot 
to get this house? Are you actually as stupid as you 
look?” 

“Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but 
again, Vernon waved her down: Slights on his 
personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to 
the danger he had spotted. 

“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve 
already got a house, my godfather left me one. So why 
would I want this one? All the happy memories?” 

There was silence. Harry thought he had rather 
impressed his uncle with this argument. 

“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet 
again, “that this Lord Thing — ” 

Page | 33 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ — Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve 
been through this about a hundred times already. 

This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dumbledore told you last 
year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley — ” 

Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and 
Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward 
off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days 
into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully grown 
wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley 
Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most 
unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to 
admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had once 
demolished half of the living room, his reappearance 
could not have been expected to delight Uncle 
Vernon. 

“ — Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” 
Harry pressed on remorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, 
the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, 
and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure 
Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to 
try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by 
holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.” 

Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure 
that in that instant they were both wondering the 
same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry 
resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding and the Order 
wants to help. You’re being offered serious protection, 
the best there is.” 

Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up 
and down. Outside the sun hung low over the privet 
hedges. The next-door neighbor’s lawn mower stalled 
again. 

“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked 
Vernon Dursley abruptly. 

Page | 34 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“There is,” said Harry, surprised. 



“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me 
that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than 
harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for 
government protection!” 

Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so 
very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the 
establishment, even within this world that he 
despised and mistrusted. 

“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” 
Harry replied. “We think the Ministry has been 
infiltrated.” 

Uncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, 
breathing so heavily that his great black mustache 
rippled, his face still purple with concentration. 

“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet 
again. “All right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, 
we accept this protection. I still don’t see why we can’t 
have that Kingsley bloke.” 

Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. 
This question had also been addressed half a dozen 
times. 

“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth, 
“Kingsley is protecting the Mug — I mean, your Prime 
Minister.” 

“Exactly — he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing 
at the blank television screen. The Dursleys had 
spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along 
discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he 
visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had 
mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to 
Page | 35 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, 
deep voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to 
Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done 
with any other wizard, although it was true that they 
had never seen him with his earring in. 

“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and 
Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the job — ” 

“If we’d even seen CVs ...” began Uncle Vernon, but 
Harry lost patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced 
on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set himself. 

“These accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and 
explosions and derailments and whatever else has 
happened since we last watched the news. People are 
disappearing and dying and he’s behind it — 
Voldemort. I’ve told you this over and over again, he 
kills Muggles for fun. Even the fogs — they’re caused 
by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they 
are, ask your son!” 

Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. 
With his parents’ and Harry’s eyes upon him, he 
slowly lowered them again and asked, “There are . . . 
more of them?” 

“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that 
attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, there are 
hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as 
they feed off fear and despair — ” 

“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. 

“You’ve made your point — ” 

“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, 
all of them — Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even 
Inferi — which means dead bodies enchanted by a 
Dark wizard — will be able to find you and will 

Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




certainly attack you. And if you remember the last 
time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you 11 agree 
you need help.” 

There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of 
Hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed 
to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt 
Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was 
staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, 
“But what about my work? What about Dudley’s 
school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a 
bunch of layabout wizards — ” 

“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will 
torture and kill you like they did my parents !” 

“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad — I’m going 
with these Order people.” 

“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, 
you’re talking sense.” 

He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was 
frightened enough to accept the Order’s help, his 
parents would accompany him: There could be no 
question of being separated from their Diddykins. 
Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the 
mantelpiece. 

“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and 
when none of the Dursleys replied, he left the room. 
The prospect of parting — probably forever — from 
his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able 
to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was 
nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What 
did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years’ 
solid dislike? 



Page | 37 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his 
rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through 
the bars of Hedwig’s cage. They fell with dull thuds to 
the bottom, where she ignored them. 

“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And 
then you’ll be able to fly again.” 

The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back 
out of his room and downstairs. It was too much to 
expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys 
on their own. 

“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the 
moment Harry had opened the door; a small man in a 
mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow. “An 
honor, as ever!” 

“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and 
embarrassed smile upon the dark-haired Hestia. “It’s 
really good of you to do this. ... They’re through here, 
my aunt and uncle and cousin. ...” 

“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said 
Dedalus happily, striding into the living room. The 
Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed 
thus; Harry half expected another change of mind. 
Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of 
the witch and wizard. 

“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, 
as Harry has told you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, 
pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat 
and examining it. “We shall be leaving before Harry 
does. Due to the danger of using magic in your house 
— Harry being still underage, it could provide the 
Ministry with an excuse to arrest him — we shall be 
driving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to 
the safe location we have picked out for you. You

know how to drive, I take it?” he asked Uncle Vernon 
politely. 

“Know how to — ? Of course I ruddy well know how to 
drive!” spluttered Uncle Vernon. 

“Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would 
be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and 
knobs,” said Dedalus. He was clearly under the 
impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley, 
who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with 
every word Dedalus spoke. 

“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his 
mustache rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither 
Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him. 

“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for 
your guard. There has been a little change in the 
arrangements — ” 

“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought 
Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by Side- 
Along- Apparition?” 

“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will 
explain.” 

The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with 
looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, jumped 
as a loud voice screeched, “Hurry up\” Harry looked 
all around the room before realizing that the voice 
had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch. 

“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” 
said Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it 
back into his waistcoat. “We are attempting to time 
your departure from the house with your family’s 
Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at the 
Page | 39 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the 
Dursleys. “Well, are we all packed and ready to go?” 

None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still 
staring, appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat 
pocket. 

“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, 

Dedalus,” murmured Hestia. She clearly felt that it 
would be tactless for them to remain in the room 
while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, 
possibly tearful farewells. 

“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon 
made any further explanation unnecessary by saying 
loudly, 

“Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.” 

He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s 
hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face 
it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it 
backward and forward like a metronome. 

“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking 
the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at 
Harry altogether. 

Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his 
mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry a little of the 
giant, Grawp. 

“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon. 

He had already reached the living room door when 
Dudley mumbled, “I don’t understand.” 

“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt 
Petunia, looking up at her son. 

Page | 40 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at 
Harry. 

“Why isn’t he coming with us?” 

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they 
stood, staring at Dudley as though he had just 
expressed a desire to become a ballerina. 

“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly. 

“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley. 

“Well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, 
turning to glare at Harry and adding, “You don’t want 
to, do you?” 

“Not in the slightest,” said Harry. 

“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley. “Now 
come on, we’re off.” 

He marched out of the room. They heard the front 
door open, but Dudley did not move and after a few 
faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too. 

“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the 
doorway. 

It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts 
too difficult to put into words. After several moments 
of apparently painful internal struggle he said, “But 
where’s he going to go?” 

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. 
It was clear that Dudley was frightening them. Hestia 
Jones broke the silence. 



Page | 41 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But . . . surely you know where your nephew is 
going?” she asked, looking bewildered. 

“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off 
with some of your lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get 
in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry.” 

Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front 
door, but Dudley did not follow. 

“Off with some of our lot?” 

Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude 
before: Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his 
closest living relatives took so little interest in the 
famous Harry Potter. 

“It’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, 
honestly.” 

“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising 
ominously. “Don’t these people realize what you’ve 
been through? What danger you are in? The unique 
position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort 
movement?” 

“Er — no, they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a 
waste of space, actually, but I’m used to — ” 

“I don’t think you’re a waste of space.” 

If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might 
not have believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for 
several seconds before accepting that it must have 
been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, 

Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and 
astonished himself. 

“Well ... er ... thanks, Dudley.” 

Page | 42 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too 
unwieldy for expression before mumbling, “You saved 
my life.” 

“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the 
dementor would have taken. ...” 

He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had 
virtually no contact during this summer or last, as 
Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and 
kept to his room so much. It now dawned on Harry, 
however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had 
trodden that morning might not have been a booby 
trap at all. Although rather touched, he was 
nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to 
have exhausted his ability to express his feelings. 
After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley 
subsided into scarlet-faced silence. 

Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her 
an approving look that changed to outrage as Aunt 
Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather 
than Harry. 

“S-so sweet, Dudders ...” she sobbed into his massive 
chest. “S-such a lovely b-boy ... s-saying thank you 



“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia 
indignantly. “He only said he didn’t think Harry was a 
waste of space!” 

“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’ 
” said Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to 
laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley 
as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building. 



Page | 43 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, 
reappearing yet again at the living room door. “I 
thought we were on a tight schedule!” 

“Yes — yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had 
been watching these exchanges with an air of 
bemusement and now seemed to pull himself 
together. “We really must be off. Harry — ” 

He tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both 
of his own. 

“ — good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the 
Wizarding world rest upon your shoulders.” 

“Oh,” said Harry, “right. Thanks.” 

“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. 
“Our thoughts go with you.” 

“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance 
toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley. 

“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” 
said Diggle brightly, waving his hat as he left the 
room. Hestia followed him. 

Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s 
clutches and walked toward Harry, who had to 
repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then 
Dudley held out his large, pink hand. 

“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s 
renewed sobs, “did the dementors blow a different 
personality into you?” 

“Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.” 



Page | 44 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah ...” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and 
shaking it. “Maybe. Take care, Big D.” 

Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. 
Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, 
and then a car door slammed. 

Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her 
handkerchief, looked around at the sound. She did 
not seem to have expected to find herself alone with 
Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her 
pocket, she said, “Well — good-bye,” and marched 
toward the door without looking at him. 

“Good-bye,” said Harry. 

She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry 
had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say 
something to him: She gave him an odd, tremulous 
look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but 
then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of 
the room after her husband and son.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE SEVEN POTTERS 

Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at 
the window just in time to see the Dursleys’ car 
swinging out of the drive and off up the road. 
Dedalus’s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia 
and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right at 
the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for 
a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was 
gone. 

Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his 
rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last 
sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back 
downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, 
broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The 
light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows 
in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here 
in the silence and know that he was about to leave 
the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had 
been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy 
themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare 
treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the 
fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley’s 

Page | 46 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



computer, or put on the television and flicked through 
the channels to his heart’s content. It gave him an 
odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was 
like remembering a younger brother whom he had 
lost. 

“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he 
asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head 
under her wing. “We’ll never be here again. Don’t you 
want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at 
this doormat. What memories ... Dudley puked on it 
after I saved him from the dementors. ... Turns out he 
was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last 
summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. 



Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment 
and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but 
continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry 
turned his back on the front door. 

“And under here, Hedwig” — Harry pulled open a door 
under the stairs — “is where I used to sleep! You 
never knew me then — Blimey, it’s small, I’d 
forgotten. ...” 

Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and 
umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every 
morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, 
which was more often than not adorned with a spider 
or two. Those had been the days before he had known 
anything about his true identity; before he had found 
out how his parents had died or why such strange 
things often happened around him. But Harry could 
still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even 
in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of 
green light and once — Uncle Vernon had nearly 
crashed the car when Harry had recounted it — a 
flying motorbike . . . 

Page | 47 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere 
nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and 
smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. 
Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon’s 
choicest swear words, he staggered back into the 
kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the 
window into the back garden. 

The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself 
quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to pop into 
sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. 
Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet 
and goggles and sitting astride an enormous 
motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around 
him other people were dismounting from brooms and, 
in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses. 

Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into 
their midst. There was a general cry of greeting as 
Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped 
him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All righ’, Harry? 
Ready fer the off?” 

“Definitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all. 
“But I wasn’t expecting this many of you!” 

“Change of plan,” growled Mad-Eye, who was holding 
two enormous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye 
was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden 
with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s get undercover before we 
talk you through it.” 

Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, 
laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat 
themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work 
surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless 
appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her 
bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, 
grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long- 
P a g e | 48 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his 
spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one- 
legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its 
socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite 
shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, 
slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde 
hair; Kingsley, bald, black, broad-shouldered; Hagrid, 
with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked 
to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and 
Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with 
his droopy basset hound’s eyes and matted hair. 
Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: 
He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even 
Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last 
time they had met. 

“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle 
Prime Minister?” he called across the room. 

“He can get along without me for one night,” said 
Kingsley. “You’re more important.” 

“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on 
top of the washing machine, and she wiggled her left 
hand at him; a ring glittered there. 

“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to 
Lupin. 

“I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very 
quiet.” 

“That’s brilliant, congrat — ” 

“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up 
later!” roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell 
in the kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet 
and turned to Harry. “As Dedalus probably told you, 
we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone 
Page | 49 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it an 
imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo 
Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. 
All done in the name of your protection, to prevent 
You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely 
pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that 
already. What he’s really done is to stop you getting 
out of here safely. 

“Second problem: You’re underage, which means 
you’ve still got the Trace on you.” 

“I don’t — ” 

“The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. 

“The charm that detects magical activity around 
under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out 
about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, 
casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is 
going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters. 

“We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the 
moment you turn seventeen you’ll lose all the 
protection your mother gave you. In short: Pius 
Thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and 
proper.” 

Harry could not help but agree with the unknown 
Thicknesse. 

“So what are we going to do?” 

“We’re going to use the only means of transport left to 
us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we 
don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, 
thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.” 



Page | 50 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held 
his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address 
them. 

“Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two 
conditions: when you come of age, or” — Moody 
gestured around the pristine kitchen — “you no 
longer call this place home. You and your aunt and 
uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full 
understanding that you’re never going to live together 
again, correct?” 

Harry nodded. 

“So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going 
back, and the charm will break the moment you get 
outside its range. We’re choosing to break it early, 
because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who 
to come and seize you the moment you turn 
seventeen. 

“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You- 
Know-Who doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. 
We’ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think 
you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is 
You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t just 
rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to 
have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in 
this general area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen 
different houses every protection we can throw at 
them. They all look like they could be the place we’re 
going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection 
with the Order: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly’s 
Auntie Muriel’s — you get the idea.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he 
could still spot a gaping hole in the plan. 



Page | 51 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re 
within the boundaries of the protective enchantments 
we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a 
Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?” 

“Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know 
which of the twelve secure houses I’m heading for at 
first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once” — he 
performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of us fly off 
toward Tonks’s parents’?” 

“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. 
Fourteen of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents’. 
There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the 
skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each 
pair heading for a different safe house.” 

From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of 
what looked like mud. There was no need for him to 
say another word; Harry understood the rest of the 
plan immediately. 

“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the 
kitchen. “No way!” 

“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione 
with a hint of complacency. 

“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives 

— !” 

“ — because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron. 

“This is different, pretending to be me — ” 

“Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,” said Fred 
earnestly. “Imagine if something went wrong and we 
were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.” 



Page | 52 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry did not smile. 



“You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to 
give you some hair.” 

“Well, that’s that plan scuppered,” said George. 
“Obviously there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit 
of your hair unless you cooperate.” 

“Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not 
allowed to use magic; we’ve got no chance,” said Fred. 

“Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.” 

“If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled 
Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its 
socket as he glared at Harry. “Everyone here’s 
overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the 
risk.” 

Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye 
swerved sideways to glare at him out of the side of 
Moody’s head. 

“Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I 
want a few of your hairs, boy, now.” 

“But this is mad, there’s no need — ” 

“No need!” snarled Moody. “With You-Know-Who out 
there and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if 
we’re lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and 
he’ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but 
he’d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping 
an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to 
get at you or this house while your mother’s charm 
holds, but it’s about to break and they know the 
rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use 

Page | 53 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




decoys. Even You-Know-Who can’t split himself into 
seven.” 

Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at 
once. 

“So, Potter — some of your hair, if you please.” 

Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just- 
do-it sort of way. 

“Now!” barked Moody. 

With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to 
the top of his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and 
pulled. 

“Good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the 
stopper out of the flask of potion. “Straight in here, if 
you please.” 

Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The 
moment it made contact with its surface, the potion 
began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned 
a clear, bright gold. 

“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, 
Harry,” said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s 
raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh, 
you know what I mean — Goyle ’s potion looked like 
bogies.” 

“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” 
said Moody. 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in 
front of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink. 

“We’re one short,” said Lupin. 

Page | 54 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Here,” said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus 
by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down 
beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and 
moved along to stand between Fred and George 
instead. 

“I’ve toldjer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said 
Mundungus. 

“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, 
you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into 
will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. 
Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want 
to finish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who 
have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll 
want to kill them.” 

Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but 
Moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized 
glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, 
before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. 

“Altogether, then ...” 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus 
drank. All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion 
hit their throats: At once, their features began to 
bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and 
Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and 
George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, 
Hermione’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward 
into their skulls. 

Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the 
ties of the large sacks he had brought with him. When 
he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters 
gasping and panting in front of him. 



Page | 55 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Fred and George turned to each other and said 
together, “Wow — we’re identical!” 

“I dunno, though, I think I’m still better-looking,” said 
Fred, examining his reflection in the kettle. 

“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave 
door, “Bill, don’t look at me — I’m ’ideous.” 

“Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller 
here,” said Moody, indicating the first sack, “and vice 
versa. Don’t forget the glasses, there’s six pairs in the 
side pocket. And when you’re dressed, there’s luggage 
in the other sack.” 

The real Harry thought that this might just be the 
most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen 
some extremely odd things. He watched as his six 
doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out 
sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own 
things away. He felt like asking them to show a little 
more respect for his privacy as they all began 
stripping off with impunity, clearly much more at ease 
with displaying his body than they would have been 
with their own. 

“I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,” said Ron, 
looking down at his bare chest. 

“Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Hermione, 
as she put on glasses. 

Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and 
owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from 
the second sack. 

“Good,” said Moody, as at last seven dressed, 
bespectacled, and luggage-laden Harrys faced him. 



Page | 56 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be 
traveling with me, by broom — ” 

“Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the 
back door. 

“Because you’re the one that needs watching,” 
growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical eye did 
not waver from Mundungus as he continued, “Arthur 
and Fred — ” 

“I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was 
pointing. “Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re 
Harry?” 

“Sorry, George — ” 

“I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really — ” 

“Enough messing around!” snarled Moody. “The other 
one — George or Fred or whoever you are — you’re 
with Remus. Miss Delacour — ” 

“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not 
that fond of brooms.” 

Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a 
soppy, slavish look that Harry hoped with all his 
heart would never appear on his face again. 

“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral — ” 

Hermione looked reassured as she answered 
Kingsley’s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too 
lacked confidence on a broomstick. 

“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, 
knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. 



“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?” said 
Hagrid, looking a little anxious. “We’ll be on the bike, 
brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see. Not a 
lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll 
be in the sidecar.” 

“That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully. 

“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a 
broom,” said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry 
was feeling. “Snape’s had plenty of time to tell them 
everything about you he’s never mentioned before, so 
if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting 
they’ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on 
a broomstick. All right then,” he went on, tying up the 
sack with the fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading 
the way back to the door, “I make it three minutes 
until we’re supposed to leave. No point locking the 
back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when 
they come looking. ... Come on. ...” 

Harry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack, 
Firebolt, and Hedwig’s cage before joining the others 
in the dark back garden. On every side broomsticks 
were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been 
helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, 
Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing 
ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. 

“Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?” 

“The very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. 
“An’ the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh 
in one hand!” 

Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he 
got into the sidecar. It placed him several feet below 

Page | 58 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him 
sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry 
stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet 
and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. It was 
extremely uncomfortable. 

“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite 
oblivious to Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself 
astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and 
sank inches into the ground. “It’s got a few tricks up 
its handlebars now. Tha’ one was my idea.” 

He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the 
speedometer. 

“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who 
was standing beside them, holding his broomstick. 
“I’m still not sure that was advisable and it’s certainly 
only to be used in emergencies.” 

“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please; 

I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the 
whole point of the diversion’s lost.” 

Everybody mounted their brooms. 

“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw 
Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before 
placing his hands on either side of her waist. Hagrid 
kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a dragon, 
and the sidecar began to vibrate. 

“Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody. “See you all in 
about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. 
One ... two ... THREE.” 

There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry 
felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch: He was rising 
through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair 

Page | 59 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were 
soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral 
flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by 
Hedwig’s cage and his rucksack, were already sore 
and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort 
that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number 
four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge 
of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it 
was. Higher and higher they climbed into the sky — 

And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were 
surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, suspended 
in midair, formed a vast circle in the midst of which 
the Order members had risen, oblivious — 

Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid 
gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost 
any sense of where they were: Streetlights above him, 
yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for 
dear life. Hedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his 
rucksack slipped from beneath his knees — 

“No — HEDWIG!” 

The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed 
to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the 
cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. 
A second’s relief, and then another burst of green 
light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the 
cage. 

“No — NO!” 

The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed 
hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted 
through their circle. 

“Hedwig — Hedwig — ” 



Page | 60 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on 
the floor of her cage. He could not take it in, and his 
terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over 
his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares 
of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring 
off into the distance, but he could not tell who they 
were — 

“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he 
yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling 
out his wand, ramming Hedwig’s cage onto the floor, 
refusing to believe that she was dead. “Hagrid, TURN 
AROUND!” 

“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed 
Hagrid, and he opened the throttle. 

“Stop — STOP!” Harry shouted, but as he looked back 
again two jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four 
Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and 
were pursuing them, aiming for Hagrid ’s broad back. 
Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping 
up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and 
Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. 
Wriggling around he cried, “Stupefy\” and a red bolt of 
light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between 
the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to 
avoid it. 

“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and 
Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming 
a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. 

A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust 
pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into 
being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved 
and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: He 
vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder 
from behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. 
Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they 
and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as 
Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. 

More Killing Curses flew past Harry’s head from the 
two remaining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming 
for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning 
Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower 
of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of 
fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no 
idea what was happening — 

“Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and 
he jabbed at a second button. This time a great net 
burst from the bike’s exhaust, but the Death Eaters 
were ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, 
but the companion who had slowed to save their 
unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed 
suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them 
were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after 
it. 

“This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and 
Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple 
button beside the speedometer. 

With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire 
burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the 
motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of 
wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve 
out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at 
the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its 
metal connections to the bike had splintered with the 
force of acceleration. 

“It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat 
onto his back by the surge of speed; nobody was 
steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist 
violently in the bike’s slipstream. 

Page | 62 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from 
inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink 
umbrella. 

“Hagrid! No! Let me!” 

“REPAROl” 

There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke 
away from the bike completely: Harry sped forward, 
propelled by the impetus of the bike’s flight, then the 
sidecar began to lose height — 

In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar 
and shouted, “Wingardium Leviosal” 

The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least 
still airborne: He had but a split second’s relief, 
however, as more curses streaked past him: The three 
Death Eaters were closing in. 

“I’m cornin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the 
darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning 
to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he 
pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and 
yelled, “Impedimental” 

The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For 
a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in 
midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One 
of his fellows almost collided with him — 

Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the 
remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry 
that he had to duck below the rim of the car, 
knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat — 

“I’m cornin’, Harry, I’m cornin’!” 



Page | 63 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




A huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and 
hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry 
pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself 
onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself back-to- 
back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from 
the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out 
of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, 
and yelled, “Confringo\” 

He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig 
as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted 
off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell 
back and vanished. 

“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I 
shouldn’ta tried ter repair it meself — yeh’ve got no 
room — ” 

“It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” Harry shouted 
back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the 
darkness, drawing closer. 

As the curses came shooting across the intervening 
space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry 
knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire 
button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry 
sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their 
pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another 
blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater 
swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the 
red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the 
strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike — Stan — 

“ ExpelliarmusV’ Harry yelled. 

“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!” 

The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even 
above the thunder of the motorbike’s engine: Next 

Page | 64 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




moment, both pursuers had fallen back and 
disappeared from view. 



“Harry, what’s happened?” bellowed Hagrid. 

“Where Ve they gone?” 

“I don’t know!” 

But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had 
shouted “It’s the real one!”; how had he known? He 
gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and 
felt its menace. Where were they? 

He clambered around on the seat to face forward and 
seized hold of the back of Hagrid ’s jacket. 

“Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of 
here!” 

“Hold on tight, then, Harry!” 

There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the 
white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt 
himself slipping backward off what little of the seat he 
had, Hagrid flung backward upon him, barely 
maintaining his grip on the handlebars — 

“I think we’ve lost ’em Harry, I think we’ve done it!” 
yelled Hagrid. 

But Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at him as 
he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure 
would come. ... Why had they fallen back? One of 
them had still had a wand. ... It’s him ... it’s the real 
one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to 
Disarm Stan. ... 

“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” 
shouted Hagrid. 

Page | 65 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights 
down on the ground still seemed remote as stars. 

Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire; as a 
Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two 
Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from 
behind — 

And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like 
smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to 
hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out of the 
blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again — 

Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the 
motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for dear 
life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into 
the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and 
knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a 
bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike 
spiraled through the air, completely out of control — 

Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no 
idea which way was up, which down: His scar was 
still burning; he expected to die at any second. A 
hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he 
saw it raise its arm — 

“NO!” 

With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the 
bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both 
Hagrid and the Death Eater falling out of sight, their 
combined weight too much for the broomstick — 

Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, 
Harry heard Voldemort scream, “Mine\” 



Page | 66 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort 
was; he glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out 
of the way and heard, “Avada — ” 

As the pain from Harry’s scar forced his eyes shut, 
his wand acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his 
hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of 
golden fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a 
crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death 
Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, “ No\ Somehow, 
Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire 
button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and 
the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling 
straight toward the ground. 

“Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear 
life. “Hagrid — Accio Hagridl” 

The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. 

Face level with the handlebars, Harry could see 
nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: 
He was going to crash and there was nothing he could 
do about it. Behind him came another scream, “Your 
wand, Selwyn, give me your wand\” 

He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking 
sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure 
they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort 
preparing to curse him once more — 

And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down 
and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below 
him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting 
him, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, 
ground-trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy 
pond. 



Page | 67

FALLEN WARRIOR 



“Hagrid?” 

Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of 
metal and leather that surrounded him; his hands 
sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand. 
He could not understand where Voldemort had gone 
and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any 
moment. Something hot and wet was trickling down 
his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the 
pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on 
the ground that was Hagrid. 

“Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me — ” 

But the dark mass did not stir. 

“Who’s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?” 

Harry did not recognize the man’s voice. Then a 
woman shouted, “They’ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in 
the garden!” 



Page | 68 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Harry’s head was swimming. 



“Hagrid,” he repeated stupidly, and his knees 
buckled. 

The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on 
what felt like cushions, with a burning sensation in 
his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been 
regrown. The scar on his forehead was still throbbing. 

“Hagrid?” 

He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a 
sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. His 
rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet 
and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was 
watching Harry anxiously. 

“Hagrid’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing 
to him now. How are you feeling? Anything else 
broken? I’ve fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your 
arm. I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks — Dora’s father.” 

Harry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his 
eyes and he felt sick and giddy. 

“Voldemort — ” 

“Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on 
Harry’s shoulder and pushing him back against the 
cushions. “That was a nasty crash you just had. What 
happened, anyway? Something go wrong with the 
bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him 
and his Muggle contraptions?” 

“No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open 
wound. “Death Eaters, loads of them — we were 
chased — ” 

Page | 69 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Death Eaters?” said Ted sharply. “What d’you mean, 
Death Eaters? I thought they didn’t know you were 
being moved tonight, I thought — ” 

“They knew,” said Harry. 

Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could 
see through it to the sky above. 

“Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, 
don’t we? They shouldn’t be able to get within a 
hundred yards of the place in any direction.” 

Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; 
it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed 
the barrier of the Order’s charms. He only hoped they 
would continue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a 
hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for 
a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great 
transparent bubble. 

He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see 
Hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that 
he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when 
a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his 
face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but 
miraculously alive. 

“Harry!” 

Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, 
he covered the floor between them in two strides and 
pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly 
repaired ribs. “Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ 
that? I thought we were both goners.” 

“Yeah, me too. I can’t believe — ” 



Page | 70 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who 
had entered the room behind Hagrid. 

“You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his 
pocket, but it was empty. 

“Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on 
Harry’s arm. “It fell right beside you, I picked it up. 
And that’s my wife you’re shouting at.” 

“Oh, I’m — I’m sorry.” 

As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s 
resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less 
pronounced: Her hair was a light, soft brown and her 
eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked 
a little haughty after Harry’s exclamation. 

“What happened to our daughter?” she asked. “Hagrid 
said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?” 

“I don’t know,” said Harry. “We don’t know what 
happened to anyone else.” 

She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and 
guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their expressions; if 
any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his 
fault. He had consented to the plan, given them his 
hair. ... 

“The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden. 
“We’ve got to get back to the Burrow and find out — 
then well be able to send you word, or — or Tonks 
will, once she’s — ” 

“Dora’ll be okay, ’Dromeda,” said Ted. “She knows her 
stuff, she’s been in plenty of tight spots with the 
Aurors. The Portkey ’s through here,” he added to 



Page | 71 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry. “It’s supposed to leave in three minutes, if you 
want to take it.” 



“Yeah, we do,” said Harry. He seized his rucksack, 
swung it onto his shoulders. “I — ” 

He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the 
state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt 
so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him 
that did not seem hollow and insincere. 

“Ill tell Tonks — Dora — to send word, when she ... 
Thanks for patching us up, thanks for everything. I — 



He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks 
along a short hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid 
came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his 
head on the door lintel. 

“There you go, son. That’s the Portkey.” 

Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed 
hairbrush lying on the dressing table. 

“Thanks,” said Harry, reaching out to place a finger 
on it, ready to leave. 

“Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around. 

“Harry, where’s Hedwig?” 

“She ... she got hit,” said Harry. 

The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of 
himself as the tears stung his eyes. The owl had been 
his companion, his one great link with the magical 
world whenever he had been forced to return to the 
Dursleys. 

Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him 
painfully on the shoulder. 

“Never mind,” he said gruffly. “Never mind. She had a 
great old life — ” 

“Hagrid!” said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush 
glowed bright blue, and Hagrid only just got his 
forefinger to it in time. 

With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible 
hook and line had dragged him forward, Harry was 
pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his 
finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled 
away from Mr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry’s feet 
slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands 
and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard 
screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing 
hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw 
Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by 
the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on 
landing, clambered laboriously to his feet. 

“Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? 
Where are the others?” cried Mrs. Weasley. 

“What d’you mean? Isn’t anyone else back?” Harry 
panted. 

The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley ’s pale 
face. 

“The Death Eaters were waiting for us,” Harry told 
her. “We were surrounded the moment we took off — 
they knew it was tonight — I don’t know what 
happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it 
was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort 
caught up with us — ” 



Page | 73 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the 
plea for her to understand why he did not know what 
had happened to her sons, but — 

“Thank goodness you’re all right,” she said, pulling 
him into a hug he did not feel he deserved. 

“Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?” asked 
Hagrid a little shakily. “Fer medicinal purposes?” 

She could have summoned it by magic, but as she 
hurried back toward the crooked house, Harry knew 
that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny 
and she answered his unspoken plea for information 
at once. 

“Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they 
missed their Portkey, it came back without them,” she 
said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground 
nearby. “And that one,” she pointed at an ancient 
sneaker, “should have been Dad and Fred’s, they 
were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were 
third and,” she checked her watch, “if they made it, 
George and Lupin ought to be back in about a 
minute.” 

Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, 
which she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked it and 
drank it straight down in one. 

“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet 
away. 

A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew 
larger and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, 
spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately 
that there was something wrong: Lupin was 
supporting George, who was unconscious and whose 
face was covered in blood. 

Page | 74 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry ran forward and seized George’s legs. Together, 
he and Lupin carried George into the house and 
through the kitchen to the sitting room, where they 
laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell across 
George’s head, Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach 
lurched: One of George’s ears was missing. The side 
of his head and neck were drenched in wet, 
shockingly scarlet blood. 

No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than 
Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged 
him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where 
Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through 
the back door. 

“Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly. “Le’ go of him! Le’ go of 
Harry!” 

Lupin ignored him. 

“What creature sat in the corner the first time that 
Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?” he said, 
giving Harry a small shake. “Answer me!” 

“A — a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?” 

Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen 
cupboard. 

“Wha’ was tha’ about?” roared Hagrid. 

“I’m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,” said Lupin 
tersely. “We’ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew that 
you were being moved tonight and the only people 
who could have told him were directly involved in the 
plan. You might have been an impostor.” 

“So why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted Hagrid, still 
struggling to fit through the door. 

Page | 75 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re half-giant,” said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. 
“The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use 
only.” 

“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we 
were moving tonight,” said Harry. The idea was 
dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. 
“Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, 
he didn’t know which one I was in the beginning. If 
he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the 
start I was the one with Hagrid.” 

“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. 
“What happened? How did you escape?” 

Harry explained briefly how the Death Eaters 
pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the 
true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how 
they must have summoned Voldemort, who had 
appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the 
sanctuary of Tonks’s parents. 

“They recognized you? But how? What had you 
done?” 

“I ...” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey 
seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. “I saw 
Stan Shunpike. ... You know, the bloke who was the 
conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm 
him instead of — well, he doesn’t know what he’s 
doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!” 

Lupin looked aghast. 

“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people 
are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you 
aren’t prepared to kill!”

“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and 
if I Stunned him and he’d fallen, he’d have died the 
same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus 
saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added 
defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering 
Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry 
for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how to 
Disarm. 

“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a 
great number of Death Eaters witnessed that 
happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual 
move then, under imminent threat of death. 

Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who 
either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was 
close to suicidal!” 

“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” 
said Harry angrily. 

“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — 
frankly, most people! — would have expected you to 
attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but 
the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature 
move, and I urge you not to let it become so!” 

Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there 
was still a grain of defiance inside him. 

“I won’t blast people out of my way just because 
they’re there,” said Harry. “That’s Voldemort’s job.” 

Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in 
squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a 
chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. 

Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry 
addressed Lupin again. 

“Will George be okay?” 

Page | 77 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




All Lupin’s frustration with Harry seemed to drain 
away at the question. 

“I think so, although there’s no chance of replacing 
his ear, not when it’s been cursed off — ” 

There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for 
the back door; Harry leapt over Hagrid’s legs and 
sprinted into the yard. 

Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry 
ran toward them he realized they were Hermione, now 
returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, 
both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione flung 
herself into Harry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no 
pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione ’s 
shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it 
at Lupin’s chest. 

“The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair 
of us?” 

“ ‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,’ ” said 
Lupin calmly. 

Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, 
“It’s him, I’ve checked!” 

“All right, all right!” said Kingsley, stowing his wand 
back beneath his cloak. “But somebody betrayed us! 
They knew, they knew it was tonight!” 

“So it seems,” replied Lupin, “but apparently they did 
not realize that there would be seven Harrys.” 

“Small comfort!” snarled Kingsley. “Who else is back?” 

“Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.” 



Page | 78 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. 



“What happened to you?” Lupin asked Kingsley. 

“Followed by five, injured two, might’ve killed one,” 
Kingsley reeled off, “and we saw You-Know-Who as 
well, he joined the chase halfway through but 
vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can — ” 

“Fly,” supplied Harry. “I saw him too, he came after 
Hagrid and me.” 

“So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley. “I 
couldn’t understand why he’d vanished. But what 
made him change targets?” 

“Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,” 
said Lupin. 

“Stan?” repeated Hermione. “But I thought he was in 
Azkaban?” 

Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. 

“Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout 
which the Ministry has hushed up. Travers’s hood fell 
off when I cursed him, he’s supposed to be inside too. 
But what happened to you, Remus? Where’s George?” 

“He lost an ear,” said Lupin. 

“Lost an — ?” repeated Hermione in a high voice. 

“Snape’s work,” said Lupin. 

“ Snape ?” shouted Harry. “You didn’t say — ” 

“He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra 
was always a specialty of Snape’s. I wish I could say 

Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




I’d paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to 
keep George on the broom after he was injured, he 
was losing so much blood.” 

Silence fell between the four of them as they looked 
up at the sky. There was no sign of movement; the 
stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, 
unobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where 
were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, 
Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus? 

“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from 
the door, in which he was stuck again. Glad of 
something to do, Harry pulled him free, then headed 
through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting 
room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still 
tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his 
bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a 
clean, gaping hole where George’s ear had been. 

“How is he?” 

Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, “I can’t make it 
grow back, not when it’s been removed by Dark 
Magic. But it could have been so much worse. ... He’s 
alive.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Thank God.” 

“Did I hear someone else in the yard?” Ginny asked. 

“Hermione and Kingsley,” said Harry. 

“Thank goodness,” Ginny whispered. They looked at 
each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; 
he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was 
there, but before he could act on the impulse there 
was a great crash from the kitchen. 



Page | 80 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, 
now back off if you know what’s good for you!” 

Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that 
before. He burst into the living room, his bald patch 
gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right 
behind him, both pale but uninjured. 

“Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank goodness!” 

“How is he?” 

Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For 
the first time since Harry had known him, Fred 
seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back 
of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could not 
believe what he was seeing. 

Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their 
father’s arrival, George stirred. 

“How do you feel, Georgie?” whispered Mrs. Weasley. 
George’s fingers groped for the side of his head. 
“Saintlike,” he murmured. 

“What’s wrong with him?” croaked Fred, looking 
terrified. “Is his mind affected?” 

“Saintlike,” repeated George, opening his eyes and 
looking up at his brother. “You see ... I’m holy. Hole v, 
Fred, geddit?” 

Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded 
Fred’s pale face. 



Page | 81 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Pathetic,” he told George. “Pathetic! With the whole 
wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for 
holey?” 

“Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked 
mother. “You’ll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, 
Mum.” 

He looked around. 

“Hi, Harry — you are Harry, right?” 

“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa. 

“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George. 
“Why aren’t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?” 

“They’re not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley. 
George’s grin faded. 

Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to 
accompany him back outside. As they walked through 
the kitchen she said in a low voice, “Ron and Tonks 
should be back by now. They didn’t have a long 
journey; Auntie Muriel’s not that far from here.” 

Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at 
bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but now it 
enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, 
throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As they 
walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny 
took his hand. 

Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing 
up at the sky every time he turned. Harry was 
reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a 
million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood 
shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None 



Page | 82 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined 
their silent vigil. 

The minutes stretched into what might as well have 
been years. The slightest breath of wind made them 
all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree 
in the hope that one of the missing Order members 
might leap unscathed from its leaves — 

And then a broom materialized directly above them 
and streaked toward the ground — 

“It’s them!” screamed Hermione. 

Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and 
pebbles everywhere. 

“Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom 
into Lupin’s arms. His face was set and white: He 
seemed unable to speak. Ron tripped dazedly toward 
Harry and Hermione. 

“You’re okay,” he mumbled, before Hermione flew at 
him and hugged him tightly. 

“I thought — I thought — ” 

“ ’M all right,” said Ron, patting her on the back. “ ’M 
fine.” 

“Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing 
her hold on Lupin. “Wonderful. Stunned one of the 
Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you’re 
aiming at a moving target from a flying broom — ” 

“You did?” said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her 
arms still around his neck. 



Page | 83 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Always the tone of surprise,” he said a little 
grumpily, breaking free. “Are we the last back?” 

“No,” said Ginny, “we’re still waiting for Bill and Fleur 
and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I’m going to tell Mum 
and Dad you’re okay, Ron — ” 

She ran back inside. 

“So what kept you? What happened?” Lupin sounded 
almost angry at Tonks. 

“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much 
as she wants Harry, Remus, she tried very hard to kill 
me. I just wish I’d got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we 
definitely injured Rodolphus. ... Then we got to Ron’s 
Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she 
was fussing over us — ” 

A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but 
seemed unable to say anything else. 

“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning 
to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley. 

They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but 
all the time the continued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad- 
Eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a 
frost, its icy bite harder and harder to ignore. 

“I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I 
should have been there an hour ago,” said Kingsley 
finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. “Let me 
know when they’re back.” 

Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley 
walked away into the darkness toward the gate. Harry 
thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley 
Disapparated just beyond the Burrow’s boundaries. 

Page | 84 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Mr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back 
steps, Ginny behind them. Both parents hugged Ron 
before turning to Lupin and Tonks. 

“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.” 

“Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once. 

“How’s George?” asked Lupin. 

“What’s wrong with him?” piped up Ron. 

“He’s lost — ” 

But the end of Mrs. Weasley ’s sentence was drowned 
in a general outcry: A thestral had just soared into 
sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur 
slid from its back, windswept but unhurt. 

“Bill! Thank God, thank God — ” 

Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed 
upon her was perfunctory. Looking directly at his 
father, he said, “Mad-Eye’s dead.” 

Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though 
something inside him was falling, falling through the 
earth, leaving him forever. 

“We saw it,” said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks 
glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen 
window. “It happened just after we broke out of the 
circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by us, they were 
heading north too. Voldemort — he can fly — went 
straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry 
out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. 
Voldemort’s curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell 
backward off his broom and — there was nothing we 



Page | 85 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our 
own tail — ” 



Bill’s voice broke. 

“Of course you couldn’t have done anything,” said 
Lupin. 

They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not 
quite comprehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it could not be. 

... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate 
survivor ... 

At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody 
said it, that there was no point waiting in the yard 
anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living 
room, where Fred and George were laughing together. 

“What’s wrong?” said Fred, scanning their faces as 
they entered. “What’s happened? Who’s — ?” 

“Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Weasley. “Dead.” 

The twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody 
seemed to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently 
into a handkerchief: She had been close to Mad-Eye, 
Harry knew, his favorite and his protegee at the 
Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the 
floor in the corner where he had most space, was 
dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized 
handkerchief. 

Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a 
bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses. 

“Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent 
twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each 
of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. “Mad-Eye.” 

Page | 86 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Mad-Eye,” they all said, and drank. 

“Mad-Eye,” echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. 

The firewhisky seared Harry’s throat. It seemed to 
burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness 
and sense of unreality, firing him with something that 
was like courage. 

“So Mundungus disappeared?” said Lupin, who had 
drained his own glass in one. 

The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked 
tense, watching Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it 
seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they 
might hear. 

“I know what you’re thinking,” said Bill, “and I 
wondered that too, on the way back here, because 
they seemed to be expecting us, didn’t they? But 
Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. They didn’t know 
there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the 
moment we appeared, and in case you’ve forgotten, it 
was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of 
skullduggery. Why wouldn’t he have told them the 
essential point? I think Dung panicked, it’s as simple 
as that. He didn’t want to come in the first place, but 
Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went 
straight for them. It was enough to make anyone 
panic.” 

“You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected 
him to,” sniffed Tonks. “Mad-Eye said he’d expect the 
real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled 
Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and when 
Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley. 



Page | 87 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but 
still eet does not explain ’ow zey knew we were moving 
’Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must ’ave been 
careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is 
ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not 
ze ’ole plan.” 

She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched 
on her beautiful face, silently daring any of them to 
contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break 
the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind 
his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had 
just risked his own life to save Harry’s — Hagrid, 
whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been 
tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in 
exchange for a dragon’s egg. ... 

“No,” Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, 
surprised: The firewhisky seemed to have amplified 
his voice. “I mean ... if somebody made a mistake,” 
Harry went on, “and let something slip, I know they 
didn’t mean to do it. It’s not their fault,” he repeated, 
again a little louder than he would usually have 
spoken. “We’ve got to trust each other. I trust all of 
you, I don’t think anyone in this room would ever sell 
me to Voldemort.” 

More silence followed his words. They were all looking 
at him; Harry felt a little hot again, and drank some 
more firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he 
thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been 
scathing about Dumbledore’s willingness to trust 
people. 

“Well said, Harry,” said Fred unexpectedly. 

“Yeah, ’ear, ’ear,” said George, with half a glance at 
Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched. 



Page | 88 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at 
Harry. It was close to pitying. 

“You think I’m a fool?” demanded Harry. 

“No, I think you’re like James,” said Lupin, “who 
would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to 
mistrust his friends.” 

Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father 
had been betrayed by his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He 
felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin 
had turned away from him, set down his glass upon a 
side table, and addressed Bill, “There’s work to do. I 
can ask Kingsley whether — ” 

“No,” said Bill at once, “I’ll do it, I’ll come.” 

“Where are you going?” said Tonks and Fleur 
together. 

“Mad-Eye’s body,” said Lupin. “We need to recover it.” 

“Can’t it — ?” began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing 
look at Bill. 

“Wait?” said Bill. “Not unless you’d rather the Death 
Eaters took it?” 

Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good-bye and left. 

The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except 
for Harry, who remained standing. The suddenness 
and completeness of death was with them like a 
presence. 

“I’ve got to go too,” said Harry. 



Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him. 

Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t be silly, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What are 
you talking about?” 

“I can’t stay here.” 

He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, it had 
not hurt like this for more than a year. 

“You’re all in danger while I’m here. I don’t want — ” 

“But don’t be so silly!” said Mrs. Weasley. “The whole 
point of tonight was to get you here safely, and thank 
goodness it worked. And Fleur’s agreed to get married 
here rather than in France, we’ve arranged everything 
so that we can all stay together and look after you — ” 

She did not understand; she was making him feel 
worse, not better. 

“If Voldemort finds out I’m here — ” 

“But why should he?” asked Mrs. Weasley. 

“There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,” 
said Mr. Weasley. “He’s got no way of knowing which 
safe house you’re in.” 

“It’s not me I’m worried for!” said Harry. 

“We know that,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “but it 
would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless 
if you left.” 

“Yer not goin’ anywhere,” growled Hagrid. “Blimey, 
Harry, after all we wen’ through ter get you here?” 

“Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?” said George, 
hoisting himself up on his cushions. 



Page | 90 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I know that — ” 



“Mad-Eye wouldn’t want — ” 

“I KNOW!” Harry bellowed. 

He felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think 
he did not know what they had done for him, didn’t 
they understand that it was for precisely that reason 
that he wanted to go now, before they had to suffer 
any more on his behalf? There was a long and 
awkward silence in which his scar continued to 
prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by 
Mrs. Weasley. 

“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can 
put her up with Pigwidgeon and give her something to 
eat.” 

His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her 
the truth. He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid 
answering. 

“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said 
Hagrid. “Escaped him, fought him off when he was 
right on top of yeh!” 

“It wasn’t me,” said Harry flatly. “It was my wand. My 
wand acted of its own accord.” 

After a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But 
that’s impossible, Harry. You mean that you did 
magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.” 

“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have 
told you where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in 
my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and 
it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made 
gold flames appear before.” 

Page | 91 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a 
pressured situation you can produce magic you never 
dreamed of. Small children often find, before they’re 
trained — ” 

“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. 
His scar was burning: He felt angry and frustrated; he 
hated the idea that they were all imagining him to 
have power to match Voldemort’s. 

No one said anything. He knew that they did not 
believe him. Now that he came to think of it, he had 
never heard of a wand performing magic on its own 
before. 

His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not 
to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, he set 
down his glass and left the room. 

As he crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal 
thestral looked up, rustled its enormous batlike 
wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the 
gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown 
plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking 
of Dumbledore. 

Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. 
Dumbledore would have known how and why Harry’s 
wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore 
always had the answers; he had known about wands, 
had explained to Harry the strange connection that 
existed between his wand and Voldemort’s. ... But 
Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his 
parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry 
could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in 
his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky . . . 



Page | 92 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar 
peaked. As he clutched his forehead and closed his 
eyes, a voice screamed inside his head. 



“ You told me the problem would be solved by using 
another’s wand\” 

And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated 
old man lying in rags upon a stone floor, screaming, a 
horrible, drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable 
agony. ... 

“No! No! I beg you, I beg you. ...” 

“You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!” 

“I did not. ... I swear I did not. ...” 

“You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!” 

“I swear I did not. ... I believed a different wand would 
work. ...” 

“Explain, then, what happened. Lucius’s wand is 
destroyed!” 

“I cannot understand. ... The connection ... exists 
only ... between your two wands. ...” 

“Lies!” 

“Please ... I beg you. ...” 

And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt 
Voldemort ’s surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old 
man on the floor writhe in agony — 

“Harry?” 

Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood 
shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate into the 
garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was 
several moments before he realized that Ron and 
Hermione were at his side. 

“Harry, come back in the house,” Hermione 
whispered. “You aren’t still thinking of leaving?” 

“Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thumping 
Harry on the back. 

“Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough 
now to look into Harry’s face. “You look awful!” 

“Well,” said Harry shakily, “I probably look better 
than Ollivander. ...” 

When he had finished telling them what he had seen, 
Ron looked appalled, but Hermione downright 
terrified. 

“But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar — it 
wasn’t supposed to do this anymore! You mustn’t let 
that connection open up again — Dumbledore wanted 
you to close your mind!” 

When he did not reply, she gripped his arm. 

“Harry, he’s taking over the Ministry and the 
newspapers and half the Wizarding world! Don’t let 
him inside your head too!”

THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS 

The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in 
the days that followed; Harry kept expecting to see 
him stumping in through the back door like the other 
Order members, who passed in and out to relay news. 
Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his 
feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out 
on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon 
as possible. 

“Well, you can’t do anything about the” — Ron 
mouthed the word Horcruxes — “till you’re seventeen. 
You’ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan 
here as well as anywhere, can’t we? Or,” he dropped 
his voice to a whisper, “d’you reckon you already 
know where the You-Know-Whats are?” 

“No,” Harry admitted. 

“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said 
Ron. “She said she was saving it for when you got 
here.” 



Page | 95 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley 
and Bill had just left for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone 
upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur 
had drifted off to take a bath. 

“The Trace’ll break on the thirty- first,” said Harry. 
“That means I only need to stay here four days. Then 
I can — ” 

“Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly. “We’ve got to 
stay for the wedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it.” 

Harry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. 
Weasley. 

“It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked 
mutinous. 

“Don’t they realize how important — ?” 

“ ’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a 
clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you 
about that.” 

Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check 
that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned 
in closer to Harry. 

“Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. 
What we’re off to do. She’ll try you next, so brace 
yourself. Dad and Lupin ’ve both asked as well, but 
when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone 
except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s 
determined.” 

Ron’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly 
before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the 
others by asking him to help identify a lone man’s 
sock that she thought might have come out of his 

Page | 96 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny 
scullery off the kitchen, she started. 

“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of 
you are dropping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a 
light, casual tone. 

“Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah. We are.” 

The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, 
wringing out what looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s 
vests. 

“May I ask why you are abandoning your education?” 
said Mrs. Weasley. 

“Well, Dumbledore left me ... stuff to do,” mumbled 
Harry. “Ron and Hermione know about it, and they 
want to come too.” 

“What sort of ‘stuff’?” 

“I’m sorry, I can’t — ” 

“Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to 
know, and I’m sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would 
agree!” said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been afraid of 
the “concerned parent” attack. He forced himself to 
look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that 
they were precisely the same shade of brown as 
Ginny’s. This did not help. 

“Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. 
Weasley. I’m sorry. Ron and Hermione don’t have to 
come, it’s their choice — ” 

“I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped, 
dropping all pretense now. “You’re barely of age, any 
of you! It’s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed 

Page | 97 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




work doing, he had the whole Order at his command! 
Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably 
he was telling you something he wanted done, and 
you took it to mean that he wanted you — ” 

“I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry flatly. “It’s got to 
be me.” 

He handed her back the single sock he was supposed 
to be identifying, which was patterned with golden 
bulrushes. 

“And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere 
United.” 

“Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden 
and rather unnerving return to her casual tone. “I 
should have realized. Well, Harry, while we’ve still got 
you here, you won’t mind helping with the 
preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will you? 
There’s still so much to do.” 

“No — I — of course not,” said Harry, disconcerted by 
this sudden change of subject. 

“Sweet of you,” she replied, and she smiled as she left 
the scullery. 

From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione so busy with preparations for the 
wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The 
kindest explanation of this behavior would have been 
that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from 
thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent 
journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of 
color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de- 
gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook 
vast batches of canapes, however, Harry started to 
suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she 
Page | 98 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione 
away from one another; he had not had a chance to 
speak to the two of them alone since the first night, 
when he had told them about Voldemort torturing 
Ollivander. 

“I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of 
you getting together and planning, she’ll be able to 
delay you leaving,” Ginny told Harry in an undertone, 
as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of 
his stay. 

“And then what does she think’s going to happen?” 
Harry muttered. “Someone else might kill off 
Voldemort while she’s holding us here making vol-au- 
vents?” 

He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s 
face whiten. 

“So it’s true?” she said. “That’s what you’re trying to 
do?” 

“I — not — I was joking,” said Harry evasively. 

They stared at each other, and there was something 
more than shock in Ginny’s expression. Suddenly 
Harry became aware that this was the first time that 
he had been alone with her since those stolen hours 
in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was 
sure she was remembering them too. Both of them 
jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, 
Kingsley, and Bill walked in. 

They were often joined by other Order members for 
dinner now, because the Burrow had replaced 
number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the 
headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after 
the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of 
Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the people to whom Dumbledore had confided 
Grimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret- 
Keeper in turn. 

“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly 
dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times 
as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the 
secret out of somebody. We can’t expect it to hold 
much longer.” 

“But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the 
address by now?” asked Harry. 

“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against 
Snape in case he turns up there again. We hope 
they’ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to 
bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but 
we can’t be sure. It would have been insane to keep 
using the place as headquarters now that its 
protection has become so shaky.” 

The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was 
difficult to maneuver knives and forks. Harry found 
himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things 
that had just passed between them made him wish 
they had been separated by a few more people. He 
was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he 
could barely cut his chicken. 

“No news about Mad-Eye?” Harry asked Bill. 

“Nothing,” replied Bill. 

They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, 
because Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body. 
It had been difficult to know where he might have 
fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the 
battle. 



Page | 100 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him 
dying or about finding the body,” Bill went on. “But 
that doesn’t mean much. It’s keeping a lot quiet these 
days.” 

“And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the 
underage magic I used escaping the Death Eaters?” 
Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who 
shook his head. 

“Because they know I had no choice or because they 
don’t want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked 
me?” 

“The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit 
that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that 
Azkaban’s seen a mass breakout.” 

“Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, 
clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on 
the back of his right hand stood out, white against his 
skin: I must not tell lies. 

“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to 
him?” asked Ron angrily. 

“Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,” Mr. Weasley 
replied, “terrified that they will be next to disappear, 
their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty 
rumors going around; I for one don’t believe the 
Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She 
hasn’t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile 
Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day: I 
just hope he’s working on a plan.” 

There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked 
the empty plates onto the work surface and served 
apple tart. 



Page | 101 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We must decide ’ow you will be disguised, ’Arry,” said 
Fleur, once everyone had pudding. “For ze wedding,” 
she added, when he looked confused. “Of course, 
none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot 
guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey 
’ave ’ad champagne.” 

From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected 
Hagrid. 

“Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of 
the table, where she sat, spectacles perched on the 
end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that 
she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. 
“Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?” 

“ Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and 
glaring at his mother. “Why does my room have to be 
cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!” 

“We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few 
days’ time, young man — ” 

“And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked 
Ron furiously. “No! So why in the name of Merlin’s 
saggy left — ” 

“Don’t talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley 
firmly. “And do as you’re told.” 

Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his 
spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his 
apple tart. 

“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” Harry told Ron, 
but Mrs. Weasley cut across him. 

“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur 
muck out the chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so 

Page | 102 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




grateful if you’d change the sheets for Monsieur and 
Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at 
eleven tomorrow morning.” 

But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the 
chickens. “There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” 
Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the 
coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was 
left of Sirius’s bike and, er, I’m hiding — that’s to say, 
keeping — it in here. Fantastic stuff: There’s an 
exhaust gaskin, as I believe it’s called, the most 
magnificent battery, and it’ll be a great opportunity to 
find out how brakes work. I’m going to try and put it 
all back together again when Molly’s not — I mean, 
when I’ve got time.” 

When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was 
nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to 
Ron’s attic bedroom. 

“I’m doing it, I’m doing — ! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in 
relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down 
on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The 
room was just as messy as it had been all week; the 
only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the 
far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her 
feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized 
as his own, into two enormous piles. 

“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp 
bed. 

“And how did you manage to get away?” 

“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me 
to change the sheets yesterday,” said Hermione. She 
threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and 
The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other. 



Page | 103 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” Ron told 
Harry. “I reckon he might have survived.” 

“But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said 
Harry. 

“Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How 
can he be sure what he saw?” 

“Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell 
about a thousand feet,” said Hermione, now weighing 
Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. 

“He could have used a Shield Charm — ” 

“Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” 
said Harry. 

“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron 
grumpily, punching his pillow into a more 
comfortable shape. 

“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said 
Hermione, looking shocked. “It’s dreadful that he’s 
dead! But we’re being realistic!” 

For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye’s body, 
broken as Dumbledore’s had been, yet with that one 
eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of 
revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh. 

“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after 
themselves, that’s why no one’s found him,” said Ron 
wisely. 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a 
bone and buried in Hagrid’s front garden. They 
probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him — ” 



Page | 104 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked 
over just in time to see her burst into tears over her 
copy of Spellman’s Syllabary. 

“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old 
camp bed. “Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset — ” 

But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron 
bounded off the bed and got there first. One arm 
around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and 
withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he 
had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling 
out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, 

“ Tergeo .” 

The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking 
rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the slightly 
smoking handkerchief to Hermione. 

“Oh ... thanks, Ron. ... I’m sorry. ...” She blew her 
nose and hiccuped. “It’s just so awf-ful, isn’t it? R- 
right after Dumbledore ... I j-just n-never imagined 
Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!” 

“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But 
you know what he’d say to us if he was here?” 

“ ‘C-constant vigilance,’ ” said Hermione, mopping her 
eyes. 

“That’s right,” said Ron, nodding. “He’d tell us to learn 
from what happened to him. And what I’ve learned is 
not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.” 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to 
pick up two more books. A second later, Ron had 
snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; 
she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his 



Page | 105 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




foot. The book had broken free from its restraining 
belt and snapped viciously at Ron’s ankle. 



“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” Hermione cried as Harry 
wrenched the book from Ron’s leg and retied it shut. 

“What are you doing with all those books anyway?” 
Ron asked, limping back to his bed. 

“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” 
said Hermione. “When we’re looking for the 
Horcruxes.” 

“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his 
forehead. “I forgot we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in 
a mobile library.” 

“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s 
Syllabary. “I wonder ... will we need to translate 
runes? It’s possible. ... I think we’d better take it, to 
be safe.” 

She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two 
piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History. 

“Listen,” said Harry. 

He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at 
him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance. 

“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you 
wanted to come with me,” Harry began. 

“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. 

“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to 
the books. “You know, I think I will take Hogwarts, A 
History. Even if we’re not going back there, I don’t 
think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with — ” 

Page | 106 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Listen!” said Harry again. 



“No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming 
with you. That was decided months ago — years, 
really.” 

“But — ” 

“Shut up,” Ron advised him. 

“ — are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry 
persisted. 

“Let’s see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with 
Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. 
“I’ve been packing for days, so we’re ready to leave at 
a moment’s notice, which for your information has 
included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to 
mention smuggling Mad-Eye’s whole stock of 
Polyjuice Potion right under Ron’s mum’s nose. 

“I’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that 
they’re convinced they’re really called Wendell and 
Monica Wilkins, and that their life’s ambition is to 
move to Australia, which they have now done. That’s 
to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them 
down and interrogate them about me — or you, 
because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit 
about you. 

“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll 
find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don’t 
— well, I think I’ve cast a good enough charm to keep 
them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins 
don’t know that they’ve got a daughter, you see.” 

Hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron 
got back off the bed, put his arm around her once 
more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching 

Page | 107 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything 
to say, not least because it was highly unusual for 
Ron to be teaching anyone else tact. 

“I — Hermione, I’m sorry — I didn’t — ” 

“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well 
what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. 
Ron, show Harry what you’ve done.” 

“Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron. 

“Go on, he needs to know!” 

“Oh, all right. Harry, come here.” 

For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from 
around Hermione and stumped over to the door. 

“C’mon.” 

“Why?” Harry asked, following Ron out of the room 
onto the tiny landing. 

“ Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the 
low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their heads and 
a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half- 
sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square 
hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains. 

“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had 
never actually met the creature that sometimes 
disrupted the nightly silence. 

“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come 
and have a look at him.” 

Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the 
tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were in the 

Page | 108 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




room before he caught sight of the creature curled up 
a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its 
large mouth wide open. 

“But it ... it looks ... do ghouls normally wear 
pajamas?” 

“No,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or 
that number of pustules.” 

Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was 
human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now 
that Harry’s eyes became used to the darkness, was 
clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas. He was also sure 
that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, 
rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry 
purple blisters. 

“He’s me, see?” said Ron. 

“No,” said Harry. “I don’t.” 

“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to 
me,” said Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, 
which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined 
Hermione, who was still sorting books. 

“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live 
down here in my room,” said Ron. “I think he’s really 
looking forward to it — well, it’s hard to tell, because 
all he can do is moan and drool — but he nods a lot 
when you mention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me 
with spattergroit. Good, eh?” 

Harry merely looked his confusion. 

“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not 
grasped the brilliance of the plan. “Look, when we 
three don’t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone’s 

Page | 109 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




going to think Hermione and I must be with you, 
right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight 
for our families to see if they’ve got information on 
where you are.” 

“But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum 
and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are talking about 
going into hiding at the moment,” said Hermione. 

“We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and 
they can’t all leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re 
going to put out the story that I’m seriously ill with 
spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back to school. If 
anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can 
show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. 
Spattergroit ’s really contagious, so they’re not going 
to want to go near him. It won’t matter that he can’t 
say anything, either, because apparently you can’t 
once the fungus has spread to your uvula.” 

“And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked 
Harry. 

“Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the 
ghoul. Mum ... well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She 
won’t accept we’re going till we’ve gone.” 

There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle 
thuds as Hermione continued to throw books onto 
one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry 
looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. 
The measures they had taken to protect their families 
made him realize, more than anything else could have 
done, that they really were going to come with him 
and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would 
be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, 
but he simply could not find words important enough. 



Page | 110 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. 
Weasley shouting from four floors below. 

“Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy 
napkin ring,” said Ron. “I dunno why the Delacours 
have got to come two days before the wedding.” 

“Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for 
the rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on her 
own,” said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over 
Break with a Banshee. 

“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” 
said Ron. 

“What we really need to decide,” said Hermione, 
tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without 
a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of 
Magical Education in Europe, “is where we’re going 
after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go 
to Godric’s Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why, 
but ... well ... shouldn’t we make the Horcruxes our 
priority?” 

“If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d 
agree with you,” said Harry, who did not believe that 
Hermione really understood his desire to return to 
Godric’s Hollow. His parents’ graves were only part of 
the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, 
feeling that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it 
was simply because it was there that he had survived 
Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the 
challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to 
the place where it had happened, wanting to 
understand. 

“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s 
keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione 
asked. “He might expect you to go back and visit your 

Page | 111 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you 
like?” 



This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to 
find a counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently 
following his own train of thought. 

“This R.A.B. person,” he said. “You know, the one who 
stole the real locket?” 

Hermione nodded. 

“He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn’t 
he?” 

Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled 
out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B. ’s note was still 
folded. 

“ ‘ I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy 
it as soon as I can,’ ” Harry read out. 

“Well, what if he did finish it off?” said Ron. 

“Or she,” interposed Hermione. 

“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!” 

“Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the 
real locket, aren’t we?” said Hermione, “to find out 
whether or not it’s destroyed.” 

“And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a 
Horcrux?” asked Ron. 

“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.” 

“How?” asked Harry. “I didn’t think there were any 
books on Horcruxes in the library?” 

Page | 112 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. 
“Dumbledore removed them all, but he — he didn’t 
destroy them.” 

Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. 

“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you 
managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?” 

“It — it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from 
Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. “They were 
still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken 
them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t want 
anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made 
it much harder to — ” 

“Get to the point!” said Ron. 

“Well ... it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. 

“I just did a Summoning Charm. You know — Accio. 
And — they zoomed out of Dumbledore ’s study 
window right into the girls’ dormitory.” 

“But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding 
Hermione with a mixture of admiration and 
incredulity. 

“Just after his — Dumbledore’s — funeral,” said 
Hermione in an even smaller voice. “Right after we 
agreed we’d leave school and go and look for the 
Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my 
things it — it just occurred to me that the more we 
knew about them, the better it would be ... and I was 
alone in there ... so I tried ... and it worked. They flew 
straight in through the open window and I — I packed 
them.” 

She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t 
believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it’s not 

Page | 113 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




as though we’re going to use the information to make 
a Horcrux, is it?” 

“Can you hear us complaining?” said Ron. “Where are 
these books anyway?” 

Hermione rummaged for a moment and then 
extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in faded 
black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held 
it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead. 

“This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how 
to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art — it’s a 
horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder 
when Dumbledore removed it from the library. ... If he 
didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort 
got all the instruction he needed from here.” 

“Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a 
Horcrux, then, if he’d already read that?” asked Ron. 

“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would 
happen if you split your soul into seven,” said Harry. 
“Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to 
make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about 
them. I think you’re right, Hermione, that could easily 
have been where he got the information.” 

“And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, 
“the more horrible they seem, and the less I can 
believe that he actually made six. It warns in this 
book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by 
ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!” 

Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about 
Voldemort moving beyond “usual evil.” 

“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back 
together?” Ron asked. 

Page | 114 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it 
would be excruciatingly painful.” 

“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry. 

“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel 
what you’ve done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the 
pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see Voldemort 
attempting it somehow, can you?” 

“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it 
say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?” 

“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as 
if examining rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark 
wizards how strong they have to make the 
enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what 
Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really 
foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.” 

“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry. 

“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of 
basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering 
what we were going to do with them.” 

“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione 
patiently. “It has to be something so destructive that 
the Horcrux can’t repair itself. Basilisk venom only 
has one antidote, and it’s incredibly rare — -□ 

“ — phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding. 

“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Our problem is that there 
are very few substances as destructive as basilisk 
venom, and they’re all dangerous to carry around 
with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to 
solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or 



Page | 115 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




crushing a Horcrux won’t do the trick. You’ve got to 
put it beyond magical repair.” 

“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, 
“why can’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in 
something else?” 

“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a 
human being.” 

Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly 
confused, Hermione hurried on, “Look, if I picked up 
a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, 

I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.” 

“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said 
Ron. Harry laughed. 

“It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever 
happens to your body, your soul will survive, 
untouched,” said Hermione. “But it’s the other way 
round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it 
depends on its container, its enchanted body, for 
survival. It can’t exist without it.” 

“That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, 
remembering ink pouring like blood from the 
punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of 
Voldemort’s soul as it vanished. 

“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of 
soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to 
get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, 
but obviously it came back good as new.” 

“Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that 
diary was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that 
work, then?” 



Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“While the magical container is still intact, the bit of 
soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get 
too close to the object. I don’t mean holding it for too 
long, it’s nothing to do with touching it,” she added 
before Ron could speak. “I mean close emotionally. 
Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made 
herself incredibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you 
get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.” 

“I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said 
Harry. “Why didn’t I ask him? I never really ...” 

His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the 
things he should have asked Dumbledore, and of 
how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to 
Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities 
when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more ... 
to find out everything. . . . 

The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew 
open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked 
and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks 
streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron 
jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate 
Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite 
wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before 
realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, 
whose hair was disheveled and whose face was 
contorted with rage. 

“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” 
she said, her voice trembling. “I’m sure you all need 
your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked 
in my room that need sorting out and I was under the 
impression that you had agreed to help.” 

“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt 
to her feet, sending books flying in every direction, 

“we will ... we’re sorry ...” 

Page | 117 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione 
hurried out of the room after Mrs. Weasley. 

“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained Ron in an 
undertone, still massaging his head as he and Harry 
followed. “Except without the job satisfaction. The 
sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do 
except find Horcruxes. ... It’ll be like a holiday, won’t 
it?” 



Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous 
pile of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. 
Weasley’s room, stopped quite abruptly. 

The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven 
o’clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling 
quite resentful toward Fleur’s family by this time, and 
it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs 
to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to 
flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart 
enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to 
await the visitors. 

Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The 
rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually 
littered the steps by the back door were gone, 
replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either 
side of the door in large pots; though there was no 
breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive 
rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the 
yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had 
been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, 
although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, 
thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual 
contingent of capering gnomes. 



Page | 118 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He had lost track of how many security enchantments 
had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order 
and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no 
longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly 
into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to 
meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they 
were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their 
approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, 
which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who 
appeared at the gate moments later, laden with 
luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in 
long, leaf-green robes, who could only be Fleur’s 
mother. 

“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace 
her. “Papa!” 

Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as 
his wife; he was a head shorter and extremely plump, 
with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked 
good-natured. Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley on 
high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, 
leaving her flustered. 

“You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep 
voice. “Fleur tells us you ’ave been working very ’ard.” 

“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing!” trilled Mrs. Weasley. 
“No trouble at all!” 

Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome 
who was peering out from behind one of the new 
Flutterby bushes. 

“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding 
Mrs. Weasley’s hand between his own two plump 
ones and beaming. “We are most honored at the 
approaching union of our two families! Let me present 
my wife, Apolline.” 

Page | 119 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss 
Mrs. Weasley too. 

“ Enchantee,” she said. “Your ’usband ’as been telling 
us such amusing stories!” 

Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley 
threw him a look, upon which he became immediately 
silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the 
sickbed of a close friend. 

“And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, 
Gabrielle!” said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was 
Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length 
hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a 
dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a 
glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her 
throat loudly. 

“Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and 
she ushered the Delacours into the house, with many 
“No, please!”s and “After you!”s and “Not at all!”s. 

The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, 
pleasant guests. They were pleased with everything 
and keen to assist with the preparations for the 
wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything 
from the seating plan to the bridesmaids’ shoes 
“Charmanti” Madame Delacour was most 
accomplished at household spells and had the oven 
properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her 
elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she 
could and jabbering away in rapid French. 

On the downside, the Burrow was not built to 
accommodate so many people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley 
were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted 
down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s protests and 
insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was 
Page | 120 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




sleeping with Fleur in Percy’s old room, and Bill 
would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once 
Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make 
plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it 
was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to 
escape the overcrowded house. 

“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as 
their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was 
foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a 
large basket of laundry in her arms. 

“Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she 
approached them. “We’d better shut them away again 
before the men arrive tomorrow ... to put up the tent 
for the wedding,” she explained, pausing to lean 
against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. 
“Millamant’s Magic Marquees ... they’re very good, 
Bill’s escorting them. ... You’d better stay inside while 
they’re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate 
organizing a wedding, having all these security spells 
around the place.” 

“I’m sorry,” said Harry humbly. 

“Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I 
didn’t mean — well, your safety’s much more 
important! Actually, I’ve been wanting to ask you how 
you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. 

Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day. ...” 

“I don’t want a fuss,” said Harry quickly, envisaging 
the additional strain this would put on them all. 
“Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be 
fine. ... It’s the day before the wedding. ...” 

“Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and 
Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?” 

Page | 121 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please don’t go to 
loads of trouble.” 

“Not at all, not at all ... It’s no trouble. ...” 

She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled 
a little sadly, straightened up, and walked away. 

Harry watched as she waved her wand near the 
washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air 
to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great 
wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain 
he was giving her.

THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

He was walking along a mountain road in the cool 
blue light of dawn. Far below, swathed in mist, was 
the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought 
down there, the man he needed so badly he could 
think of little else, the man who held the answer, the 
answer to his problem . . . ? 

“Oi, wake up.” 

Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the 
camp bed in Ron’s dingy attic room. The sun had not 
yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon 
was asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The 
scar on Harry’s forehead was prickling. 

“You were muttering in your sleep.” 

“Was I?” 

“Yeah. ‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’ 



Page | 123 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face 
appeared slightly blurred. 



“Who’s Gregorovitch?” 

“I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.” 

Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague 
idea he had heard the name before, but he could not 
think where. 

“I think Voldemort’s looking for him.” 

“Poor bloke,” said Ron fervently. 

Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. 
He tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the 
dream, but all that came back was a mountainous 
horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a 
deep valley. 

“I think he’s abroad.” 

“Who, Gregorovitch?” 

“Voldemort. I think he’s somewhere abroad, looking 
for Gregorovitch. It didn’t look like anywhere in 
Britain.” 

“You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?” 
Ron sounded worried. 

“Do me a favor and don’t tell Hermione,” said Harry. 
“Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in 
my sleep ...” 

He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking ... 
Why was the name “Gregorovitch” familiar? 

Page | 124 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I think,” he said slowly, “he’s got something to do 
with Quidditch. There’s some connection, but I can’t 
— I can’t think what it is.” 

“Quidditch?” said Ron. “Sure you’re not thinking of 
Gorgovitch?” 

“Who?” 

“Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the 
Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago. 
Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.” 

“No,” said Harry. “I’m definitely not thinking of 
Gorgovitch.” 

“I try not to either,” said Ron. “Well, happy birthday 
anyway.” 

“Wow — that’s right, I forgot! I’m seventeen!” 

Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, 
pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his 
glasses, and said, “Accio Glasses!” Although they were 
only around a foot away, there was something 
immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward 
him, at least until they poked him in the eye. 

“Slick,” snorted Ron. 

Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron’s 
possessions flying around the room, causing 
Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around 
his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces of his 
trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several 
minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the 
pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron’s 
Chudley Cannons posters bright blue. 



Page | 125 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” Ron advised Harry, 
sniggering when Harry immediately checked it. 

“Here’s your present. Unwrap it up here, it’s not for 
my mother’s eyes.” 

“A book?” said Harry as he took the rectangular 
parcel. “Bit of a departure from tradition, isn’t it?” 

“This isn’t your average book,” said Ron. “It’s pure 
gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. 
Explains everything you need to know about girls. If 
only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly how 
to get rid of Lavender and I would’ve known how to 
get going with ... Well, Fred and George gave me a 
copy, and I’ve learned a lot. You’d be surprised, it’s 
not all about wandwork, either.” 

When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of 
presents waiting on the table. Bill and Monsieur 
Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. 
Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan. 

“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, 
Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. “He had 
to leave early for work, but hell be back for dinner. 
That’s our present on top.” 

Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had 
indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very 
like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for 
his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling 
around the face instead of hands. 

“It’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he 
comes of age,” said Mrs. Weasley, watching him 
anxiously from beside the cooker. “I’m afraid that one 
isn’t new like Ron’s, it was actually my brother 
Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his 
possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back, but — ” 
Page | 126 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and 
hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into 
the hug and perhaps she understood them, because 
she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her, 
then waved her wand in a slightly random way, 
causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying 
pan onto the floor. 

“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying 
into the kitchen and adding her own present to the 
top of the pile. “It’s not much, but I hope you like it. 
What did you get him?” she added to Ron, who 
seemed not to hear her. 

“Come on, then, open Hermione’s!” said Ron. 

She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other 
packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and 
Fleur (“Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave 
you will ever ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour assured him, 
“but you must tell it clearly what you want . . . 
ozzerwise you might find you ’ave a leetle less hair 
zan you would like. ...”), chocolates from the 
Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest 
Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred 
and George. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, 
as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and 
Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. 

“I’ll pack these for you,” Hermione said brightly, 
taking Harry’s presents out of his arms as the three of 
them headed back upstairs. “I’m nearly done, I’m just 
waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of 
the wash, Ron — ” 

Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a 
door on the first-floor landing. 

Page | 127 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry, will you come in here a moment?” 

It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but 
Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on 
up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny 
into her room. 

He had never been inside it before. It was small, but 
bright. There was a large poster of the Wizarding 
band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of 
Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch 
team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk 
stood facing the open window, which looked out over 
the orchard where he and Ginny had once played 
two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and 
which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The 
golden flag on top was level with Ginny’s window. 

Ginny looked up into Harry’s face, took a deep breath, 
and said, “Happy seventeenth.” 

“Yeah ... thanks.” 

She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it 
difficult to look back at her; it was like gazing into a 
brilliant light. 

“Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the 
window. 

She ignored this. He could not blame her. 

“I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said. 

“You didn’t have to get me anything.” 

She disregarded this too. 



Page | 128 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, 
because you wouldn’t be able to take it with you.” 

He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that 
was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, 
she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that 
having six brothers must have toughened her up. 

She took a step closer to him. 

“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to 
remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela 
when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.” 

“I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty 
thin on the ground, to be honest.” 

“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she 
whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had 
never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her 
back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than 
firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, 
Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one 
in her long, sweet-smelling hair — 

The door banged open behind them and they jumped 
apart. 

“Oh,” said Ron pointedly. “Sorry.” 

“Ron!” Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of 
breath. There was a strained silence, then Ginny said 
in a flat little voice, 

“Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.” 

Ron’s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. 
Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it 
felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when 

Page | 129 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the door opened, and his shining moment had popped 
like a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his 
relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from 
her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, 
and all happy forgetfulness was gone. 

He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, 
though he hardly knew what, but she had turned her 
back on him. He thought that she might have 
succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do 
anything to comfort her in front of Ron. 

“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two 
out of the bedroom. 

Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded 
kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept pace with 
him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them 
looking scared. 

Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown 
lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. 

“You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing 
her around?” 

“I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as 
Hermione caught up with them. 

“Ron — ” 

But Ron held up a hand to silence her. 

“She was really cut up when you ended it — ” 

“So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t 
because I wanted to.” 



Page | 130 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just 
going to get her hopes up again — ” 

“She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s 
not expecting us to — to end up married, or — ” 

As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of 
Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and 
unpleasant stranger. In one spiraling moment it 
seemed to hit him: Her future was free and 
unencumbered, whereas his ... he could see nothing 
but Voldemort ahead. 

“If you keep groping her every chance you get — ” 

“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day 
was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun had gone 
in. “Okay?” 

Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked 
backward and forward on his feet for a moment, then 
said, “Right then, well, that’s ... yeah.” 

Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with 
Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any look or 
gesture did she show that they had shared more than 
polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, 

Charlie’s arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided 
a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie 
into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and 
announce that he was about to get a proper haircut. 

As Harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the 
Burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the 
arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several 
tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and 
George bewitched a number of purple lanterns, all 
emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in 
midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s 
Page | 131 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




ministrations, George’s wound was neat and clean, 
but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the 
side of his head, despite the twins’ many jokes about 
it. 

Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from 
the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically 
over the trees and bushes. 

“Nice,” said Ron, as with one final flourish of her 
wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple 
tree to gold. “You’ve really got an eye for that sort of 
thing.” 

“Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both 
pleased and a little confused. Harry turned away, 
smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he 
would find a chapter on compliments when he found 
time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to 
Charm Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and grinned at 
her before remembering his promise to Ron and 
hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur 
Delacour. 

“Out of the way, out of the way!” sang Mrs. Weasley, 
coming through the gate with what appeared to be a 
giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. 
Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday 
cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her 
wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven 
ground. When the cake had finally landed in the 
middle of the table, Harry said, “That looks amazing, 
Mrs. Weasley.” 

“Oh, it’s nothing, dear,” she said fondly. Over her 
shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and 
mouthed, Good one. 



Page | 132 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




By seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into 
the house by Fred and George, who had waited for 
them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the 
occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy 
brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook 
Harry’s hand, Harry thought he looked rather 
unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, 
looked simply radiant. 

“Happy birthday, Harry,” she said, hugging him 
tightly. 

“Seventeen, eh!” said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket- 
sized glass of wine from Fred. “Six years ter the day 
since we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?” 

“Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at him. “Didn’t you 
smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, 
and tell me I was a wizard?” 

“I forge’ the details,” Hagrid chortled. “All righ’, Ron, 
Hermione?” 

“We’re fine,” said Hermione. “How are you?” 

“Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn 
unicorns, I’ll show yeh when yeh get back — ” Harry 
avoided Ron’s and Hermione’s gazes as Hagrid 
rummaged in his pocket. “Here, Harry — couldn’ 
think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” 
He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch 
with a long string, evidently intended to be worn 
around the neck. “Mokeskin. Hide anythin’ in there 
an’ no one but the owner can get it out. They’re rare, 
them.” 

“Hagrid, thanks!” 



Page | 133 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ ’S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid- 
sized hand. “An’ there’s Charlie! Always liked him — 
hey! Charlie!” 

Charlie approached, running his hand slightly 
ruefully over his new, brutally short haircut. He was 
shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns 
and scratches up his muscley arms. 

“Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?” 

“Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. How’s Norbert doin’?” 

“Norbert?” Charlie laughed. “The Norwegian 
Ridgeback? We call her Norberta now.” 

“Wha — Norbert’s a girl?” 

“Oh yeah,” said Charlie. 

“How can you tell?” asked Hermione. 

“They’re a lot more vicious,” said Charlie. He looked 
over his shoulder and dropped his voice. “Wish Dad 
would hurry up and get here. Mum’s getting edgy.” 

They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying 
to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly 
at the gate. 

“I think we’d better start without Arthur,” she called 
to the garden at large after a moment or two. “He 
must have been held up at — oh!” 

They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that 
came flying across the yard and onto the table, where 
it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which 
stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley’s 
voice.

“Minister of Magic coming with me.” 

The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur’s 
family peering in astonishment at the place where it 
had vanished. 

“We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once. “Harry — 
I’m sorry — I’ll explain another time — ” 

He seized Tonks’s wrist and pulled her away; they 
reached the fence, climbed over it, and vanished from 
sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. 

“The Minister — but why — ? I don’t understand — ” 

But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second 
later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the 
gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly 
recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair. 

The two newcomers marched across the yard toward 
the garden and the lantern- lit table, where everybody 
sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As 
Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, 
Harry saw that he looked much older than the last 
time they had met, scraggy and grim. 

“Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a 
halt before the table. “Especially as I can see that I 
am gate-crashing a party.” 

His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch 
cake. 

“Many happy returns.” 

“Thanks,” said Harry. 



Page | 135 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went 
on. “Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss 
Hermione Granger.” 

“Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised. “Why us?” 

“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more 
private,” said Scrimgeour. “Is there such a place?” he 
demanded of Mr. Weasley. 

“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked 
nervous. “The, er, sitting room, why don’t you use 
that?” 

“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. 
“There will be no need for you to accompany us, 
Arthur.” 

Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with 
Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As 
they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry 
knew that the other two were thinking the same as he 
was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that 
the three of them were planning to drop out of 
Hogwarts. 

Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through 
the messy kitchen and into the Burrow’s sitting room. 
Although the garden had been full of soft golden 
evening light, it was already dark in here: Harry 
flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and 
they illuminated the shabby but cozy room. 
Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that 
Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. 
Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. 

“I have some questions for the three of you, and I 
think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two” 

Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




— he pointed at Harry and Hermione — “can wait 
upstairs, I will start with Ronald.” 

“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while 
Hermione nodded vigorously. “You can speak to us 
together, or not at all.” 

Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry 
had the impression that the Minister was wondering 
whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this 
early. 

“Very well then, together,” he said, shrugging. He 
cleared his throat. “I am here, as I’m sure you know, 
because of Albus Dumbledore’s will.” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. 

“A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that 
Dumbledore had left you anything?” 

“A-all of us?” said Ron. “Me and Hermione too?” 

“Yes, all of—” 

But Harry interrupted. 

“Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken 
this long to give us what he left us?” 

“Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour 
could answer. “They wanted to examine whatever he’s 
left us. You had no right to do that!” she said, and her 
voice trembled slightly. 

“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively. “The 
Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry 
the power to confiscate the contents of a will — ” 



Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“That law was created to stop wizards passing on 
Dark artifacts,” said Hermione, “and the Ministry is 
supposed to have powerful evidence that the 
deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing them! 
Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was 
trying to pass us something cursed?” 

“Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, 
Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour. 

“No, I’m not,” retorted Hermione. “I’m hoping to do 
some good in the world!” 

Ron laughed. Scrimgeour ’s eyes flickered toward him 
and away again as Harry spoke. 

“So why have you decided to let us have our things 
now? Can’t think of a pretext to keep them?” 

“No, it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up,” said 
Hermione at once. “They can’t keep the objects longer 
than that unless they can prove they’re dangerous. 
Right?” 

“Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, 
Ronald?” asked Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron 
looked startled. 

“Me? Not — not really ... It was always Harry who ...” 

Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see 
Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now\ sort of look, 
but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as 
though he had heard exactly what he had expected, 
and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey 
upon Ron’s answer. 

“If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you 
account for the fact that he remembered you in his 

Page | 138 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. 
The vast majority of his possessions — his private 
library, his magical instruments, and other personal 
effects — were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you 
were singled out?” 

“I ... dunno,” said Ron. “I ... when I say we weren’t 
close ... I mean, I think he liked me. ...” 

“You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione. 
“Dumbledore was very fond of you.” 

This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far 
as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been 
alone together, and direct contact between them had 
been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to 
be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and 
drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the 
one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a 
scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read 
aloud. 

“ ‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival 
Wulfric Brian Dumbledore’ ... Yes, here we are. ... ‘To 
Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the 
hope that he will remember me when he uses it.’ ” 

Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry 
had seen before: It looked something like a silver 
cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to 
suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a 
simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed 
the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it 
over in his fingers, looking stunned. 

“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching 
Ron. “It may even be unique. Certainly it is of 
Dumbledore’s own design. Why would he have left 
you an item so rare?” 

Page | 139 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron shook his head, looking bewildered. 

“Dumbledore must have taught thousands of 
students,” Scrimgeour persevered. “Yet the only ones 
he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? 
To what use did he think you would put his 
Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?” 

“Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else 
could I do with it?” 

Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After 
squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he turned back 
to Dumbledore’s will. 

“ To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of 
The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will 
find it entertaining and instructive.’ ” 

Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book 
that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the 
Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and 
peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrimgeour 
without a word. She held the book in her lap and 
gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he 
had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear 
splashed onto the embossed symbols. 

“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, 
Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour. 

“He ... he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a 
thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve. 

“But why that particular book?” 

“I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.” 



Page | 140 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing 
secret messages, with Dumbledore?” 



“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on 
her sleeve. “And if the Ministry hasn’t found any 
hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt 
that I will.” 

She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so 
tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting his arm to 
put it around Hermione ’s shoulders. Scrimgeour 
turned back to the will. 

“ ‘To Harry James Potter,’ ” he read, and Harry’s 
insides contracted with a sudden excitement, “ ‘I leave 
the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at 
Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of 
perseverance and skill.’ ” 

As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized 
golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather feebly, 
and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of 
anticlimax. 

“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked 
Scrimgeour. 

“No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read 
out, I suppose ... to remind me what you can get if 
you ... persevere and whatever it was.” 

“You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?” 

“I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?” 

“I’m asking the questions,” said Scrimgeour, shifting 
his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really 
falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows 
towered ghostly white over the hedge. 

Page | 141 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




“I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a 
Snitch,” Scrimgeour said to Harry. “Why is that?” 

Hermione laughed derisively. 

“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great 
Seeker, that’s way too obvious,” she said. “There must 
be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the 
icing!” 

“I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” 
said Scrimgeour, “but a Snitch would be a very good 
hiding place for a small object. You know why, I’m 
sure?” 

Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry 
thought that answering questions correctly was such 
a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the 
urge. 

“Because Snitches have flesh memories,” she said. 

“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both 
considered Hermione ’s Quidditch knowledge 
negligible. 

“Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched 
by bare skin before it is released, not even by the 
maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment 
by which it can identify the first human to lay hands 
upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch” — 
he held up the tiny golden ball — “will remember your 
touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who 
had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other 
faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it 
will open only for you.” 



Page | 142 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure 
that Scrimgeour was right. How could he avoid taking 
the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister? 



“You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps 
you already know what the Snitch contains?” 

“No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear 
to touch the Snitch without really doing so. If only he 
knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read 
Hermione’s mind; he could practically hear her brain 
whirring beside him. 

“Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly. 

Harry met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had 
no option but to obey. He held out his hand, and 
Scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed the 
Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry’s palm. 

Nothing happened. As Harry’s fingers closed around 
the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and were still. 
Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze 
avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still 
hoping it might transform in some way. 

“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and 
Hermione laughed. 

“That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to 
prise herself off the sofa. 

“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad- 
tempered now. “Dumbledore left you a second 
bequest, Potter.” 

“What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling. 



Page | 143 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this 
time. 

“The sword of Godric Gryffindor,” he said. 

Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked 
around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but 
Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather 
pouch, which in any case looked much too small to 
contain it. 

“So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously. 

“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was 
not Dumbledore ’s to give away. The sword of Godric 
Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as 
such, belongs — ” 

“It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose 
him, he was the one who found it, it came to him out 
of the Sorting Hat — ” 

“According to reliable historical sources, the sword 
may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor,” said 
Scrimgeour. “That does not make it the exclusive 
property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may 
have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched his badly 
shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. “Why do you think 
— ?” 

“ — Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said 
Harry, struggling to keep his temper. “Maybe he 
thought it would look nice on my wall.” 

“This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was 
it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of 
Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? 
Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he 



Page | 144 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to 
destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?” 

“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever 
tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the 
Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of 
wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or 
covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So is this what 
you’ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, 
trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying — I 
was nearly one of them — Voldemort chased me 
across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but 
there’s been no word about any of that from the 
Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to 
cooperate with you!” 

“You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; 
Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour limped 
toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with 
the point of his wand: It singed a hole in Harry’s T- 
shirt like a lit cigarette. 

“Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, 
but Harry said, 

“No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?” 

“Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said 
Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry’s face. 
“Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave 
your insolence and insubordination? You may wear 
that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a 
seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! 

It’s time you learned some respect!” 

“It’s time you earned it,” said Harry. 



Page | 145 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The floor trembled; there was a sound of running 
footsteps, then the door to the sitting room burst 
open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. 

“We — we thought we heard — ” began Mr. Weasley, 
looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and 
the Minister virtually nose to nose. 

“ — raised voices,” panted Mrs. Weasley. 

Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, 
glancing at the hole he had made in Harry’s T-shirt. 
He seemed to regret his loss of temper. 

“It — it was nothing,” he growled. “I ... regret your 
attitude,” he said, looking Harry full in the face once 
more. “You seem to think that the Ministry does not 
desire what you — what Dumbledore — desired. We 
ought to be working together.” 

“I don’t like your methods, Minister,” said Harry. 
“Remember?” 

For the second time, he raised his right fist and 
displayed to Scrimgeour the scars that still showed 
white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies. 
Scrimgeour ’s expression hardened. He turned away 
without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. 
Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at 
the back door. After a minute or so she called, “He’s 
gone!” 

“What did he want?” Mr. Weasley asked, looking 
around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley 
came hurrying back to them. 

“To give us what Dumbledore left us,” said Harry. 
“They’ve only just released the contents of his will.” 



Page | 146 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the 
three objects Scrimgeour had given them were passed 
from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the 
Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and 
lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to 
pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any 
suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left 
Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the 
Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs. 

Weasley said tentatively, “Harry, dear, everyone’s 
awfully hungry, we didn’t like to start without you. ... 
Shall I serve dinner now?” 

They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty 
chorus of “Happy Birthday” and much gulping of 
cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to 
the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky 
to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a 
tent for himself in a neighboring field. 

“Meet us upstairs,” Harry whispered to Hermione, 
while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to 
its normal state. “After everyone’s gone to bed.” 

Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, 
and Harry filled Hagrid’s mokeskin purse, not with 
gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently 
worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s 
Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and 
R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped 
the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old 
Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, 
Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside. 

“ Muffliato,” she whispered, waving her wand in the 
direction of the stairs. 

“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron. 



Page | 147 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that 
Deluminator.” 

Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he 
clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at 
once. 

“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, 
“we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant 
Darkness Powder.” 

There was a small click, and the ball of light from the 
lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all 
once more. 

“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And 
from what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!” 

“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out 
in his will just to help us turn out the lights!” 

“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate 
his will and examine everything he’d left us?” asked 
Harry. 

“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the 
will why he was leaving us these things, but that still 
doesn’t explain ...” 

"... why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was 
alive?” asked Ron. 

“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through 
The Tales of Beedle the Bard. “If these things are 
important enough to pass on right under the nose of 
the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why 
... unless he thought it was obvious?” 



Page | 148 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always 
said he was mental. Brilliant and everything, but 
cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch — what the hell 
was that about?” 

“I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour 
made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something 
was going to happen!” 

“Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he 
raised the Snitch in his fingers. “I wasn’t going to try 
too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?” 

“What do you mean?” asked Hermione. 

“The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch 
match?” said Harry. “Don’t you remember?” 

Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, 
gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to the Snitch 
and back again until he found his voice. 

“That was the one you nearly swallowed!” 

“Exactly,” said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, 
he pressed his mouth to the Snitch. 

It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment 
welled up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, 
but then Hermione cried out. 

“Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!” 

He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and 
excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon 
the smooth golden surface, where seconds before 
there had been nothing, were five words written in the 
thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as 
Dumbledore’s: 

Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




I open at the close. 

He had barely read them when the words vanished 
again. 

“ ‘I open at the close ...’ What’s that supposed to 
mean?” 

Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. 

“I open at the close ... at the close ... I open at the 
close ...” 

But no matter how often they repeated the words, 
with many different inflections, they were unable to 
wring any more meaning from them. 

“And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at 
last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in 
the Snitch’s inscription. “Why did he want Harry to 
have the sword?” 

“And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said 
quietly. “It was there, it was right there on the wall of 
his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted 
me to have it, why didn’t he just give it to me then?” 

He felt as though he were sitting in an examination 
with a question he ought to have been able to answer 
in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was 
there something he had missed in the long talks with 
Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all 
meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to 
understand? 

“And as for this book,” said Hermione, “The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard ... I’ve never even heard of them!” 



Page | 150 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” 
said Ron incredulously. “You’re kidding, right?” 



“No, I’m not!” said Hermione in surprise. “Do you 
know them, then?” 

“Well, of course I do!” 

Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron 
having read a book that Hermione had not was 
unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by 
their surprise. 

“Oh come on! All the old kids’ stories are supposed to 
be Beedle ’s, aren’t they? The Fountain of Fair 
Fortune’ ... The Wizard and the Hopping Pot’ ... 
‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ ...” 

“Excuse me?” said Hermione, giggling. “What was that 
last one? 

“Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry 
to Hermione. “You must’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty 



“Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up 
by Muggles!” said Hermione. “We didn’t hear stories 
like that when we were little, we heard ‘Snow White 
and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ — ” 

“What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron. 

“So these are children’s stories?” asked Hermione, 
bending again over the runes. 

“Yeah,” said Ron uncertainly, “I mean, that’s just 
what you hear, you know, that all these old stories 
came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like in the 
original versions.” 

Page | 151 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read 
them?” 



Something creaked downstairs. 

“Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking 
off to regrow his hair,” said Ron nervously. 

“All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered 
Hermione. “It wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.” 

“No,” agreed Ron. “A brutal triple murder by the 
bridegroom’s mother might put a bit of a damper on 
the wedding. I’ll get the lights.” 

And he clicked the Deluminator once more as 
Hermione left the room.

THE WEDDING 



Three o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry, 
Ron, Fred, and George standing outside the great 
white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of 
the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of 
Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a 
redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery 
St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using 
a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce 
Harry as “Cousin Barny” and trust to the great 
number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him. 

All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that 
they could help show people to the right seats. A host 
of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, 
along with a golden-jacketed band, and all of these 
wizards were currently sitting a short distance away 
under a tree; Harry could see a blue haze of pipe 
smoke issuing from the spot. 

Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed 
rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either 
side of a long purple carpet. The supporting poles 

Page | 153 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 



were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and 
George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden 
balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur 
would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, 
butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the 
grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. 
The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting 
was slightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt 
hot and tight in the full glare of a summer’s day. 

“When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar 
of his own robes, “I won’t be bothering with any of 
this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I’ll 
put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all 
over.” 

“She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said 
George. “Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but 
who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves — here 
they come, look.” 

Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, 
out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. 
Within minutes a procession had formed, which 
began to snake its way up through the garden toward 
the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds 
fluttered on the witches’ hats, while precious gems 
glittered from many of the wizards’ cravats; a hum of 
excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the 
sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. 

“Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,” said 
George, craning his neck for a better look. “They’ll 
need help understanding our English customs, I’ll 
look after them. ...” 

“Not so fast, Your Holeyness,” said Fred, and darting 
past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the 
procession, he said, “Here — permettez-moi to assister 

Page | 154 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




vous,” to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and 
allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to 
deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took 
charge of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry colleague 
Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry’s 
lot. 

“Wotcher,” said a familiar voice as he came out of the 
marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the 
front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the 
occasion. “Arthur told us you were the one with the 
curly hair. Sorry about last night,” she added in a 
whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. “The 
Ministry’s being very anti-werewolf at the moment 
and we thought our presence might not do you any 
favors.” 

“It’s fine, I understand,” said Harry, speaking more to 
Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but 
as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin’s face fall again 
into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but 
there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was 
causing a certain amount of disruption. Having 
misunderstood Fred’s directions he had sat himself, 
not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat 
set aside for him in the back row, but on five seats 
that now resembled a large pile of golden 
matchsticks. 

While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid 
shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry 
hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face 
with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross- 
eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of 
candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in 
front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade 
of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a 
triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around 
his neck. 

Page | 155 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Xenophilius Lovegood,” he said, extending a hand to 
Harry, “my daughter and I live just over the hill, so 
kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think 
you know my Luna?” he added to Ron. 

“Yes,” said Ron. “Isn’t she with you?” 

“She lingered in that charming little garden to say 
hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How 
few wizards realize just how much we can learn from 
the wise little gnomes — or, to give them their correct 
name, the Gernumbli gardensi.” 

“Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,” said 
Ron, “but I think Fred and George taught them 
those.” 

He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna 
rushed up. 

“Hello, Harry!” she said. 

“Er — my name’s Barny,” said Harry, flummoxed. 

“Oh, have you changed that too?” she asked brightly. 

“How did you know — ?” 

“Oh, just your expression,” she said. 

Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow 
robes, which she had accessorized with a large 
sunflower in her hair. Once you got over the 
brightness of it all, the general effect was quite 
pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling 
from her ears. 

Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an 
acquaintance, had missed the exchange between 

Page | 156 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Luna and Harry. Bidding the wizard farewell, he 
turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and 
said, “Daddy, look — one of the gnomes actually bit 
me!” 

“How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously 
beneficial!” said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna’s 
outstretched finger and examining the bleeding 
puncture marks. “Luna, my love, if you should feel 
any burgeoning talent today — perhaps an 
unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in 
Mermish — do not repress it! You may have been 
gifted by the Gernumblies!” 

Ron, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a 
loud snort. 

“Ron can laugh,” said Luna serenely as Harry led her 
and Xenophilius toward their seats, “but my father 
has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.” 

“Really?” said Harry, who had long since decided not 
to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views. “Are 
you sure you don’t want to put anything on that bite, 
though?” 

“Oh, it’s fine,” said Luna, sucking her finger in a 
dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down. “You 
look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably 
wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear 
sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.” 

As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared 
with an elderly witch clutching his arm. Her beaky 
nose, red-rimmed eyes, and feathery pink hat gave 
her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo. 

"... and your hair’s much too long, Ronald, for a 
moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin’s beard, 

Page | 157 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like 
an omelet. And who are you?” she barked at Harry. 

“Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.” 

“Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn’t Harry 
Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he 
was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely 
been boasting?” 

“No — he couldn’t come — ” 

“Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as 
he looks in press photographs, then. I’ve just been 
instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,” 
she shouted at Harry. “Goblin-made, you know, and 
been in my family for centuries. She’s a good-looking 
girl, but still — French. Well, well, find me a good 
seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought 
not to be on my feet too long.” 

Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and 
did not reappear for some time: When next they met 
at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more 
people to their places. The marquee was nearly full 
now, and for the first time there was no queue 
outside. 

“Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his 
forehead on his sleeve. “She used to come for 
Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took 
offense because Fred and George set off a Dung-bomb 
under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she’ll 
have written them out of her will — like they care, 
they’re going to end up richer than anyone in the 
family, rate they’re going. ... Wow,” he added, blinking 
rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward 
them. “You look great!” 



Page | 158 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Always the tone of surprise,” said Hermione, though 
she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored 
dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek 
and shiny. “Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn’t agree, I 
just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the 
tiara. She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?’ 
and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles.’ ” 

“Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,” said 
Ron. 

“Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging 
from the marquee with Fred. “Yeah, she’s just told me 
my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius 
was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at 
weddings.” 

“Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty- 
four hours later?” asked Hermione. 

“Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,” 
conceded George. 

“But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of 
the party,” said Fred. “He used to down an entire 
bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, 
hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of 
flowers out of his — ” 

“Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said Hermione, 
while Harry roared with laughter. 

“Never married, for some reason,” said Ron. 

“You amaze me,” said Hermione. 

They were all laughing so much that none of them 
noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with 
a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until 

Page | 159 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his 
eyes on Hermione, “You look vunderful.” 

“Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded 
bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate 
to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, 
she said, “I didn’t know you were — goodness — it’s 
lovely to see — how are you?” 

Ron’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing 
at Krum’s invitation as if he did not believe a word of 
it, he said, much too loudly, “How come you’re here?” 

“Fleur invited me,” said Krum, eyebrows raised. 

Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook 
hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to 
remove Krum from Ron’s vicinity, offered to show him 
his seat. 

“Your friend is not pleased to see me,” said Krum as 
they entered the now packed marquee. “Or is he a 
relative?” he added with a glance at Harry’s red curly 
hair. 

“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really 
listening. His appearance was causing a stir, 
particularly amongst the veela cousins: He was, after 
all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still 
craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, 
Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the 
aisle. 

“Time to sit down,” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to 
get run over by the bride.” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the 
second row behind Fred and George. Hermione looked 
rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet. After a 

Page | 160 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




few moments he muttered to Harry, “Did you see he’s 
grown a stupid little beard?” 

Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. 

A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm 
tent, the general murmuring broken by occasional 
spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley 
strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; 
Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of 
amethyst-colored robes with a matching hat. 

A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front 
of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, with large 
white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled 
and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela 
cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled 
from what seemed to be the golden balloons. 

“Ooooh!” said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat 
to look at the entrance. 

A great collective sigh issued from the assembled 
witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur 
came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur 
Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a 
very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a 
strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually 
dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it 
beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, 
both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier 
than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did 
not look as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback. 

“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong 
voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the same 
small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at 
Dumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill 



Page | 161 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and Fleur. “We are gathered here today to celebrate 
the union of two faithful souls ...” 

“Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said 
Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. “But I 
must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.” 

Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, 
then quickly faced the front again. Harry’s mind 
wandered a long way from the marquee, back to 
afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of 
the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they 
had always seemed too good to be true, as though he 
had been stealing shining hours from a normal 
person’s life, a person without a lightning-shaped 
scar on his forehead. ... 

“Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle ... ?” 

In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour 
were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. 
Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee 
told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his 
own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned 
and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. 

"... then I declare you bonded for life.” 

The tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the 
heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars 
fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined 
figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, 
the golden balloons overhead burst: Birds of paradise 
and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, 
adding their songs and chimes to the din. 

“Ladies and gentlemen!” called the tufty-haired 
wizard. “If you would please stand up!” 



Page | 162 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he 
waved his wand again. The seats on which they had 
been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas 
walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood 
beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a 
glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding 
countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from 
the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; 
the hovering chairs grouped themselves around 
small, white-clothed tables, which all floated 
gracefully back to earth around it, and the golden- 
jacketed band trooped toward a podium. 

“Smooth,” said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped 
up on all sides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin 
juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering 
piles of tarts and sandwiches. 

“We should go and congratulate them!” said 
Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where 
Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well- 
wishers. 

“Well have time later,” shrugged Ron, snatching three 
butter-beers from a passing tray and handing one to 
Harry. “Hermione, cop hold, let’s grab a table. ... Not 
there! Nowhere near Muriel — ” 

Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, 
glancing left and right as he went: Harry felt sure that 
he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they 
had reached the other side of the marquee, most of 
the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one 
where Luna sat alone. 

“All right if we join you?” asked Ron. 

“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Daddy’s just gone to give 
Bill and Fleur our present.” 

Page | 163 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?” asked 
Ron. 

Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but 
caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry 
lost track of the conversation for a few moments. 

The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to 
the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, 
Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, 
followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur’s father. 

“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the 
waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up 
and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved 
on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her 
arms. 

“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly. “Always 
good value.” 

But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor 
Krum had dropped into Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione 
looked pleasurably flustered, but this time Krum had 
not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face 
he said, “Who is that man in the yellow?” 

“That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a 
friend of ours,” said Ron. His pugnacious tone 
indicated that they were not about to laugh at 
Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. “Come and 
dance,” he added abruptly to Hermione. 

She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. 
They vanished together into the growing throng on 
the dance floor. 

“Ah, they are together now?” asked Krum, 
momentarily distracted. 

Page | 164 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Er — sort of,” said Harry. 

“Who are you?” Krum asked. 

“Barny Weasley.” 

They shook hands. 

“You, Barny — you know this man Lovegood veil?” 

“No, I only met him today. Why?” 

Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching 
Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on 
the other side of the dance floor. 

“Because,” said Krum, “if he vos not a guest of 
Fleur’s, I vould duel him, here and now, for vearing 
that filthy sign upon his chest.” 

“Sign?” said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. 
The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. 
“Why? What’s wrong with it?” 

“Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.” 

“Grindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore 
defeated?” 

“Exactly.” 

Krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, 
then he said, “Grindelvald killed many people, my 
grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never 
poverful in this country, they said he feared 
Dumbledore — and rightly, seeing how he vos 
finished. But this” — he pointed a finger at 
Xenophilius — “this is his symbol, I recognized it at 
vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vail at Durmstrang 

Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




ven he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto 
their books and clothes, thinking to shock, make 
themselves impressive — until those of us who had 
lost family members to Grindelvald taught them 
better.” 

Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered 
at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed 
incredibly unlikely that Luna’s father was a supporter 
of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed 
to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape. 

“Are you — er — quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s — ?” 

“I am not mistaken,” said Krum coldly. “I valked past 
that sign for several years, I know it veil.” 

“Well, there’s a chance,” said Harry, “that Xenophilius 
doesn’t actually know what the symbol means. The 
Lovegoods are quite ... unusual. He could easily have 
picked it up somewhere and think it’s a cross section 
of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or 
something.” 

“The cross section of a vot?” 

“Well, I don’t know what they are, but apparently he 
and his daughter go on holiday looking for them. ...” 

Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and 
her father. 

“That’s her,” he said, pointing at Luna, who was still 
dancing alone, waving her arms around her head like 
someone attempting to beat off midges. 

“Vy is she doing that?” asked Krum. 



Page | 166 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,” said 
Harry, who recognized the symptoms. 

Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was 
making fun of him. He drew his wand from inside his 
robes and tapped it menacingly on his thigh; sparks 
flew out of the end. 

“Gregorovitch!” said Harry loudly, and Krum started, 
but Harry was too excited to care; the memory had 
come back to him at the sight of Krum’s wand: 
Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before 
the Triwizard Tournament. 

“Vot about him?” asked Krum suspiciously. 

“He’s a wandmaker!” 

“I know that,” said Krum. 

“He made your wand! That’s why I thought — 
Quidditch — ” 

Krum was looking more and more suspicious. 

“How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?” 

“I ... I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry. “In a — 
a fan magazine,” he improvised wildly and Krum 
looked mollified. 

“I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with 
fans,” he said. 

“So ... er ... where is Gregorovitch these days?” 

Krum looked puzzled. 



Page | 167 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to 
purchase a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best — 
although I know, of course, that you Britons set much 
store by Ollivander.” 

Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the 
dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. So 
Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, 
and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: It 
was surely because of what Harry’s wand had done 
on the night that Voldemort had pursued him across 
the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had 
conquered the borrowed wand, something that 
Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would 
Gregorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled 
than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that 
Ollivander did not? 

“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling 
Harry to his surroundings. Krum was pointing at 
Ginny, who had just joined Luna. “She is also a 
relative of yours?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s 
seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You 
wouldn’t want to cross him.” 

Krum grunted. 

“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his 
feet again, “is the point of being an international 
Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are 
taken?” 

And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich 
from a passing waiter and make his way around the 
edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find 
Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but Ron was 
dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. 
Page | 168 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and 
watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and 
George’s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful 
about the promise he had given Ron. 

He had never been to a wedding before, so he could 
not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from 
Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the 
latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with 
two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake 
was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated 
unsupported through the crowd. As evening drew in, 
and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit 
with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became 
more and more uncontained. Fred and George had 
long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair 
of Fleur’s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat 
wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing “Odo the 
Hero” in a corner. 

Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a 
drunken uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether 
or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard 
sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made 
him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was 
topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: 
Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this 
was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the 
Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore’s obituary. 

Harry approached him. 

“May I sit down?” 

“Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather 
high-pitched, wheezy voice. 

Harry leaned in. 



Page | 169 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.” 

Doge gasped. 

“My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, 
disguised. ... I am so glad, so honored!” 

In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a 
goblet of champagne. 

“I thought of writing to you,” he whispered, “after 
Dumbledore ... the shock ... and for you, I am sure 



Doge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears. 

“I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,” 
said Harry. “I didn’t realize you knew Professor 
Dumbledore so well.” 

“As well as anyone,” said Doge, dabbing his eyes with 
a napkin. “Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t 
count Aberforth — and somehow, people never do 
seem to count Aberforth.” 

“Speaking of the Daily Prophet ... I don’t know 
whether you saw, Mr. Doge — ?” 

“Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.” 

“Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview 
Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?” 

Doge’s face flooded with angry color. 

“Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture 
might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me 
to talk to her. I am ashamed to say that I became 
rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which 

Page | 170 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast 
upon my sanity.” 

“Well, in that interview,” Harry went on, “Rita Skeeter 
hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the 
Dark Arts when he was young.” 

“Don’t believe a word of it!” said Doge at once. “Not a 
word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of 
Albus Dumbledore!” 

Harry looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face and felt, 
not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it 
was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to 
believe? Didn’t Doge understand Harry’s need to be 
sure, to know everything? 

Perhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he 
looked concerned and hurried on, “Harry, Rita 
Skeeter is a dreadful — ” 

But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle. 

“Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!” 

Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel 
standing there, the plumes dancing on her hat, a 
goblet of champagne in her hand. “She’s written a 
book about Dumbledore, you know!” 

“Hello, Muriel,” said Doge. “Yes, we were just 
discussing — ” 

“You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred and 
seven!” 

Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his 
seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung it 



Page | 171 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




around with surprising strength and plopped herself 
down upon it between Doge and Harry. 

“Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she 
said to Harry. “Now, what were you saying about Rita 
Skeeter, Elphias? You know she’s written a biography 
of Dumbledore? I can’t wait to read it, I must 
remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!” 

Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie 
Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers 
at a passing waiter for a replacement. She took 
another large gulp of champagne, belched, and then 
said, “There’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed 
frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable 
and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny 
rumors about Albus!” 

“Ill-informed sniping,” said Doge, turning radish- 
colored again. 

“You would say that, Elphias,” cackled Auntie Muriel. 
“I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in 
that obituary of yours!” 

“I’m sorry you think so,” said Doge, more coldly still. 

“I assure you I was writing from the heart.” 

“Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I 
daresay you’ll still think he was a saint even if it does 
turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!” 

“Muriell” exclaimed Doge. 

A chill that had nothing to do with the iced 
champagne was stealing through Harry’s chest. 

“What do you mean?” he asked Muriel. “Who said his 
sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill?” 

Page | 172 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!” said Auntie 
Muriel, looking delighted at the effect she had 
produced. “Anyway, how could you expect to know 
anything about it? It all happened years and years 
before you were even thought of, my dear, and the 
truth is that those of us who were alive then never 
knew what really happened. That’s why I can’t wait to 
find out what Skeeter’s unearthed! Dumbledore kept 
that sister of his quiet for a long time!” 

“Untrue!” wheezed Doge. “Absolutely untrue!” 

“He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, 
without thinking, still cold inside. 

“And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched 
Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted 
to focus upon Harry. 

“The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began 
Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, “is, I should have 
thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her 
death — ” 

“Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?” squawked 
Muriel. “Why did half of us never even know she 
existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house 
and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus 
while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being 
brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going 
on in his own house!” 

“What d’you mean, locked in the cellar?” asked Harry. 
“What is this?” 

Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again 
and answered Harry.

“Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply 
terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended 
otherwise — ” 

“She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra 
was a fine woman,” whispered Doge miserably, but 
Auntie Muriel ignored him. 

“ — proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who 
would have been mortified to produce a Squib — ” 

“Ariana was not a Squib!” wheezed Doge. 

“So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she 
never attended Hogwarts!” said Auntie Muriel. She 
turned back to Harry. “In our day, Squibs were often 
hushed up, though to take it to the extreme of 
actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and 
pretending she didn’t exist — ” 

“I tell you, that’s not what happened!” said Doge, but 
Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing 
Harry. 

“Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools 
and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle 
community . . . much kinder than trying to find them a 
place in the Wizarding world, where they must always 
be second class; but naturally Kendra Dumbledore 
wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a 
Muggle school — ” 

“Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately. “Her 
health was always too poor to permit her — ” 

“ — to permit her to leave the house?” cackled Muriel. 
“And yet she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no 
Healer was ever summoned to see her!” 



Page | 174 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Really, Muriel, how you can possibly know whether 



“For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot 
was a Healer at St. Mungo’s at the time, and he told 
my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had 
never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot 
thought!” 

Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, 
who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped 
her fingers for more champagne. Numbly Harry 
thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, 
locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the 
crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore’s sister 
suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her 
lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to 
her fate while he went off to Hogwarts, to prove 
himself brilliant and talented? 

“Now, if Kendra hadn’t died first,” Muriel resumed, 

“I’d have said that it was she who finished off Ariana 



“How can you, Muriel?” groaned Doge. “A mother kill 
her own daughter? Think what you are saying!” 

“If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning 
her daughter for years on end, why not?” shrugged 
Auntie Muriel. “But as I say, it doesn’t fit, because 
Kendra died before Ariana — of what, nobody ever 
seemed sure — ” 

“Oh, no doubt Ariana murdered her,” said Doge with 
a brave attempt at scorn. “Why not?” 

“Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for 
freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,” said 
Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. “Shake your head all you 

Page | 175 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




like, Elphias! You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you 
not?” 

“Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips. “And a 
more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. 
Albus was heartbroken — ” 

“His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth 
break Albus ’s nose halfway through the service?” 

If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was 
nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have 
stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another 
swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin. 

“How do you — ?” croaked Doge. 

“My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,” 
said Auntie Muriel happily. “Bathilda described the 
whole thing to Mother while I was listening at the 
door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told it, 
Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus ’s fault that 
Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. 
According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend 
himself, and that’s odd enough in itself, Albus could 
have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands 
tied behind his back.” 

Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of 
these old scandals seemed to elate her as much as 
they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to 
think, what to believe: He wanted the truth, and yet 
all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana 
had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that 
Dumbledore would not have intervened if such 
cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet 
there was undoubtedly something odd about the 
story. 



Page | 176 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, 
hiccuping slightly as she lowered her goblet. “I think 
Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All 
those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an important 
source close to the Dumbledores — goodness knows 
she was there all through the Ariana business, and it 
would fit!” 

“Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered 
Doge. 

“Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of A 
History of Magic?” 

The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s 
textbooks, though admittedly not one of the ones he 
had read most attentively. 

“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a 
drowning man at a life belt. “A most gifted magical 
historian and an old friend of Albus’s.” 

“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie 
Muriel cheerfully. 

“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter 
to have taken advantage of her,” said Doge, “and no 
reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have 
said!” 

“Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and 
I’m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,” said Auntie 
Muriel. “But even if Bathilda’s completely cuckoo, I’m 
sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even 
letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. ... Well 
worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.” 

Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, 
choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry 

Page | 177 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming 
eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he 
asked, “Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?” 

“Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores 
moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she 
was their neighbor.” 

“The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?” 

“Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie 
Muriel testily. 

Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, 
had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived 
and lost loved ones in Godric’s Hollow. Why? Were 
Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore ’s mother 
and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, 
perhaps walked past Lily’s and James’s to do so? And 
he had never once told Harry . . . never bothered to say 



And why it was so important, Harry could not explain 
even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to 
a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these 
experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, 
barely noticing what was going on around him, and 
did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the 
crowd until she drew up a chair beside him. 

“I simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted, slipping 
off one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. 
“Ron’s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It’s a bit 
odd, I’ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna’s 
father, it looked like they’d been arguing — ” She 
dropped her voice, staring at him. “Harry, are you 
okay?” 



Page | 178 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not 
matter. At that moment, something large and silver 
came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. 
Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the 
middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as 
those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then 
the Patronus’s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the 
loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt. 

“The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are 
coming.”

A PLACE TO HIDE 

Everything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione 
jumped to their feet and drew their wands. Many 
people were only just realizing that something strange 
had happened; heads were still turning toward the 
silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread outward in 
cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had 
landed. Then somebody screamed. 

Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the 
panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all 
directions; many were Disapparating; the protective 
enchantments around the Burrow had broken. 

“Ron!” Hermione cried. “Ron, where are you?” 

As they pushed their way across the dance floor, 
Harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in 
the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands 
raised, and heard both of them shout, “Protego\”, a 
cry that was echoed on all sides — 



Page | 180 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“Ron! Ron!” Hermione called, half sobbing as she and 
Harry were buffeted by terrified guests: Harry seized 
her hand to make sure they weren’t separated as a 
streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a 
protective charm or something more sinister he did 
not know — 

And then Ron was there. He caught hold of 
Hermione ’s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the 
spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness 
pressed in upon him; all he could feel was Hermione’s 
hand as he was squeezed through space and time, 
away from the Burrow, away from the descending 
Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort 
himself. ... 

“Where are we?” said Ron’s voice. 

Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they 
had not left the wedding after all: They still seemed to 
be surrounded by people. 

“Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, 
just walk, we need to find somewhere for you to 
change.” 

Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up 
the wide dark street thronged with late-night revelers 
and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above 
them. A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group 
of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry 
and Ron were still wearing dress robes. 

“Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,” 
Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous 
giggles at the sight of him. 



Page | 181 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak 
with me?” said Harry, inwardly cursing his own 
stupidity. “All last year I kept it on me and — ” 

“It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both 
of you,” said Hermione. “Just try and act naturally 
until — this will do.” 

She led them down a side street, then into the shelter 
of a shadowy alleyway. 

“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes ...” 
said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying 
nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which 
she was now rummaging. 

“Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and 
Ron’s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of 
jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally 
the silvery Invisibility Cloak. 

“How the ruddy hell — ?” 

“Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. 
“Tricky, but I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I 
managed to fit everything we need in here.” She gave 
the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like 
a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled 
around inside it. “Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she 
said, peering into it, “and I had them all stacked by 
subject. ... Oh well. ... Harry, you’d better take the 
Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. ...” 

“When did you do all this?” Harry asked as Ron 
stripped off his robes. 

“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials 
packed for days, you know, in case we needed to 
make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this 

Page | 182 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here. 
... I just had a feeling. ...” 

“You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his 
bundled-up robes. 

“Thank you,” said Hermione, managing a small smile 
as she pushed the robes into the bag. “Please, Harry, 
get that Cloak on!” 

Harry threw the Invisibility Cloak around his 
shoulders and pulled it up over his head, vanishing 
from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate 
what had happened. 

“The others — everyone at the wedding — ” 

“We can’t worry about that now,” whispered 
Hermione. “It’s you they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just 
put everyone in even more danger by going back.” 

“She’s right,” said Ron, who seemed to know that 
Harry was about to argue, even if he could not see his 
face. “Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after 
everyone.” 

Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not 
see him, and said, “Yeah.” But he thought of Ginny, 
and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach. 

“Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,” said 
Hermione. 

They moved back up the side street and onto the 
main road again, where a group of men on the 
opposite side was singing and weaving across the 
pavement. 



Page | 183 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court 
Road?” Ron asked Hermione. 



“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m 
sure we’re safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not 
where they’ll expect us to be.” 

“True,” said Ron, looking around, “but don’t you feel a 
bit — exposed?” 

“Where else is there?” asked Hermione, cringing as 
the men on the other side of the road started wolf- 
whistling at her. “We can hardly book rooms at the 
Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out 
if Snape can get in there. ... I suppose we could try 
my parents’ house, though I think there’s a chance 
they might check there. ... Oh, I wish they’d shut up!” 

“All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the 
other pavement was yelling. “Fancy a drink? Ditch 
ginger and come and have a pint!” 

“Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as 
Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road. 
“Look, this will do, in here!” 

It was a small and shabby all-night cafe. A light layer 
of grease lay on all the Formica- topped tables, but it 
was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first 
and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had 
her back to the entrance and did not like it: She 
glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared 
to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; 
walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. 
Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of 
Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their 
usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of 
his pocket and put them on again. 

Page | 184 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




After a minute or two, Ron said, “You know, we’re not 
far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing 
Cross — ” 

“Ron, we can’t!” said Hermione at once. 

“Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!” 

“We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the 
Ministry, what else do we need to know?” 

“Okay, okay, it was just an idea!” 

They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing 
waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two 
cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it would have 
looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen 
entered the cafe and squeezed into the next booth. 
Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. 

“I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head 
for the countryside. Once we’re there, we could send a 
message to the Order.” 

“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” 
asked Ron. 

“I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione. 

“Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, 
though they might’ve been arrested already. God, 
that’s revolting,” Ron added after one sip of the 
foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she 
shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the 
new customers’ orders. The larger of the two 
workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that 
Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She 
stared, affronted. 



Page | 185 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this 
muck,” said Ron. “Hermione, have you got Muggle 
money to pay for this?” 

“Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before 
I came to the Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the 
bottom,” sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded 
bag. 

The two workmen made identical movements, and 
Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All 
three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds 
late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the 
table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. 

The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the 
tiled wall where Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, 
still invisible, yelled, “Stupefyl” 

The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a 
jet of red light: He slumped sideways, unconscious. 
His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, 
fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from 
his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot — the 
waitress screamed and ran for the door — Harry sent 
another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the 
twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell 
missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the 
waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. 

“Expulsol” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table 
behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force 
of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt 
his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him. 

“Petrificus TotalusV’ screamed Hermione from out of 
sight, and the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to 
land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken 
china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from 



Page | 186 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray 
out of her hair and trembling all over. 

“D-diffindo,” she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who 
roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his 
jeans, leaving a deep cut. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my 
hand’s shaking! Diffindol” 

The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, 
shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. Harry 
picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to 
where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled 
across the bench. 

“I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night 
Dumbledore died,” he said. He turned over the darker 
Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes moved 
rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

“That’s Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the 
old wanted posters. I think the big one’s Thorfinn 
Rowle.” 

“Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a 
little hysterically. “How did they find us? What are we 
going to do?” 

Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head. 

“Lock the door,” he told her, “and Ron, turn out the 
lights.” 

He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking 
fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the 
Deluminator to plunge the cafe into darkness. Harry 
could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione 
earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. 



Page | 187 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What are we going to do with them?” Ron whispered 
to Harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, 
“Kill them? They’d kill us. They had a good go just 
now.” 

Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. 
Harry shook his head. 

“We just need to wipe their memories,” said Harry. 
“It’s better like that, it’ll throw them off the scent. If 
we killed them it’d be obvious we were here.” 

“You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly 
relieved. “But I’ve never done a Memory Charm.” 

“Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.” 

She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her 
wand at Dolohov’s forehead and said, “Obliviate.” 

At once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and 
dreamy. 

“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back. 
“Take care of the other one and the waitress while 
Ron and I clear up.” 

“Clear up?” said Ron, looking around at the partly 
destroyed cafe. “Why?” 

“Don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened 
if they wake up and find themselves in a place that 
looks like it’s just been bombed?” 

“Oh right, yeah ...” 

Ron struggled for a moment before managing to 
extract his wand from his pocket. 



Page | 188 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you 
packed my old jeans, they’re tight.” 

“Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed Hermione, and as she 
dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, 
Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron 
could stick his wand instead. 

Once the cafe was restored to its previous condition, 
they heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth 
and propped them up facing each other. 

“But how did they find us?” Hermione asked, looking 
from one inert man to the other. “How did they know 
where we were?” 

She turned to Harry. 

“You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on 
you, do you, Harry?” 

“He can’t have,” said Ron. “The Trace breaks at 
seventeen, that’s Wizarding law, you can’t put it on 
an adult.” 

“As far as you know,” said Hermione. “What if the 
Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a 
seventeen-year-old?” 

“But Harry hasn’t been near a Death Eater in the last 
twenty-four hours. Who’s supposed to have put a 
Trace back on him?” 

Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, 
tainted: Was that really how the Death Eaters had 
found them? 

“If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near 
me, without us giving away our position — ” he began. 

Page | 189 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We’re not splitting up!” said Hermione firmly. 



“We need a safe place to hide,” said Ron. “Give us 
time to think things through.” 

“Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. 

The other two gaped. 

“Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!” 

“Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him — 
and even if they haven’t worked,” he pressed on as 
Hermione began to argue, “so what? I swear, I’d like 
nothing better than to meet Snape!” 

“But — ” 

“Hermione, where else is there? It’s the best chance 
we’ve got. Snape’s only one Death Eater. If I’ve still 
got the Trace on me, we’ll have whole crowds of them 
on us wherever else we go.” 

She could not argue, though she looked as if she 
would have liked to. While she unlocked the cafe 
door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the 
cafe’s light. Then, on Harry’s count of three, they 
reversed the spells upon their three victims, and 
before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could 
do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
had turned on the spot and vanished into the 
compressing darkness once more. 

Seconds later Harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and 
he opened his eyes: They were now standing in the 
middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, 
dilapidated houses looked down on them from every 
side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had 
been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret- 
P a g e | 190 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few 
yards that they were not being followed or observed. 
They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the 
front door once with his wand. They heard a series of 
metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the 
door swung open with a creak and they hurried over 
the threshold. 

As Harry closed the door behind them, the old- 
fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting 
flickering light along the length of the hallway. It 
looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, 
cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the 
wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. Long 
dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius’s 
mother. The only thing that was out of place was the 
troll’s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side 
as if Tonks had just knocked it over again. 

“I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione 
whispered, pointing toward it. 

“That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron 
murmured back. 

“So where are these jinxes they put up against 
Snape?” Harry asked. 

“Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” 
suggested Ron. 

Yet they remained close together on the doormat, 
backs against the door, scared to move farther into 
the house. 

“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he 
took a step forward. 

“Severus Snape?” 

Page | 191 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Mad-Eye Moody’s voice whispered out of the 
darkness, making all three of them jump back in 
fright. “We’re not Snape!” croaked Harry, before 
something whooshed over him like cold air and his 
tongue curled backward on itself, making it 
impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside 
his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. 

The other two seemed to have experienced the same 
unpleasant sensation. Ron was making retching 
noises; Hermione stammered, “That m-must have b- 
been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for 
Snape!” 

Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something 
shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and 
before any of them could say another word, a figure 
had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and 
terrible: Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, 
her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding 
toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair 
and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, 
fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, 
dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at 
Harry. 

“No!” Harry shouted, and though he had raised his 
wand no spell occurred to him. “No! It wasn’t us! We 
didn’t kill you — ” 

On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud 
of dust: Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked 
around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the 
door with her arms over her head, and Ron, who was 
shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the 
shoulder and saying, “It’s all r-right. ... It’s g-gone. ...” 

Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the 
blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black continued to scream.

“Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on 
the house of my fathers — ” 

“SHUT UP!” Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, 
and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the 
curtains swung shut again, silencing her. 

“That ... that was ...” Hermione whimpered, as Ron 
helped her to her feet. 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “but it wasn’t really him, was it? 
Just something to scare Snape.” 

Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already 
blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had 
killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he 
led the other two up the hall, half-expecting some new 
terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a 
mouse skittering along the skirting board. 

“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” 
whispered Hermione, and she raised her wand and 
said, “Homenum revelio.” 

Nothing happened. 

“Well, you’ve just had a big shock,” said Ron kindly. 
“What was that supposed to do?” 

“It did what I meant it to do!” said Hermione rather 
crossly. “That was a spell to reveal human presence, 
and there’s nobody here except us!” 

“And old Dusty,” said Ron, glancing at the patch of 
carpet from which the corpse-figure had risen. 

“Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at 
the same spot, and she led the way up the creaking 
stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. 

Page | 193 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, 
then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, she 
perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around 
her. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy 
velvet curtain aside an inch. 

“Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “And you’d 
think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, they’d have 
followed us here. I know they can’t get in the house, 
but — what’s up, Harry?” 

Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned 
again as something flashed across his mind like a 
bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt 
a fury that was not his own pound through his body, 
violent and brief as an electric shock. 

“What did you see?” Ron asked, advancing on Harry. 
“Did you see him at my place?” 

“No, I just felt anger — he’s really angry — ” 

“But that could be at the Burrow,” said Ron loudly. 
“What else? Didn’t you see anything? Was he cursing 
someone?” 

“No, I just felt anger — I couldn’t tell — ” 

Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not 
help as she said in a frightened voice, “Your scar, 
again? But what’s going on? I thought that 
connection had closed!” 

“It did, for a while,” muttered Harry; his scar was still 
painful, which made it hard to concentrate. “I — I 
think it’s started opening again whenever he loses 
control, that’s how it used to — ” 



Page | 194 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said 
Hermione shrilly. “Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you 
to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it 
down, that’s why you were supposed to use 
Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false 
images in your mind, remember — ” 

“Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through 
gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him 
that Voldemort had once used this selfsame 
connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor 
that it had resulted in Sirius’s death. He wished that 
he had not told them what he had seen and felt; it 
made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were 
pressing against the window of the room, and still the 
pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was 
like resisting the urge to be sick. 

He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending 
to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on 
the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his 
wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus 
soar through the drawing room window and land 
upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into 
the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father. 

“Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.” 

The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out 
a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped 
onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. 

“They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, 
and Ron half laughed and hugged her. 

“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I — ” 

“It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain 
in his head. “It’s your family, ’course you’re worried. 

Page | 195 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




I’d feel the same way.” He thought of Ginny. “I do feel 
the same way.” 

The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as 
it had done in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he 
heard Hermione say, “I don’t want to be on my own. 
Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought and 
camp in here tonight?” 

He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much 
longer: He had to succumb. 

“Bathroom,” he muttered, and he left the room as fast 
as he could without running. 

He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with 
trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and 
fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt 
the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, 
saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the great 
blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and 
writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, 
wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, 
merciless voice. 

“More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to 
Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive 
this time. ... You called me back for this, to tell me 
that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give 
Rowle another taste of our displeasure. ... Do it, or 
feel my wrath yourself!” 

A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting 
across a terrified, pointed white face — with a sense 
of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving 
breaths and opened his eyes. 

He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, 
his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails 

Page | 196 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy’s 
gaunt, petrified face seemed branded on the inside of 
his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by 
the use to which Draco was now being put by 
Voldemort. 

There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped 
as Hermione’s voice rang out. 

“Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I’ve got it 
here.” 

“Yeah, great, thanks,” he said, fighting to keep his 
voice casual as he stood up to let her in.

KREACHER’S TALE 

Harry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping 
bag on the drawing room floor. A chink of sky was 
visible between the heavy curtains: It was the cool, 
clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night 
and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron 
and Hermione’s slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced 
over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside 
him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that 
Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that 
her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm curved 
to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron’s. Harry 
wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding 
hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely. 

He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed 
chandelier. Less than twenty-four hours ago, he had 
been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the 
marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It 
seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen 
now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the 
Horcruxes, of the daunting, complex mission 
Dumbledore had left him. ... Dumbledore ... 

Page | 198 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 



The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore’s 
death felt different now. The accusations he had 
heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have 
nested in his brain like diseased things, infecting his 
memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could 
Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had he 
been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse 
as long as it did not affect him? Could he have turned 
his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and 
hidden? 

Harry thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves 
Dumbledore had never mentioned there; he thought 
of mysterious objects left without explanation in 
Dumbledore’s will, and resentment swelled in the 
darkness. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? Why 
hadn’t he explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared 
about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more 
than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, 
never confided in? 

Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but 
bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something 
to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping 
bag, picked up his wand, and crept out of the room. 
On the landing he whispered, “Lumos,” and started to 
climb the stairs by wandlight. 

On the second landing was the bedroom in which he 
and Ron had slept last time they had been here; he 
glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and 
the bedclothes had been ripped back. Harry 
remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. 
Somebody had searched the house since the Order 
had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had 
pilfered plenty from this house both before and after 
Sirius died? Harry’s gaze wandered to the portrait 
that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, 
Sirius’s great-great-grandfather, but it was empty, 
Page | 199 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. 
Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in 
the headmaster’s study at Hogwarts. 

Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the 
topmost landing, where there were only two doors. 

The one facing him bore a nameplate reading SIRIUS. 
Harry had never entered his godfather’s bedroom 
before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand 
high to cast light as widely as possible. The room was 
spacious and must once have been handsome. There 
was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a 
tall window obscured by long velvet curtains, and a 
chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle stubs 
still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in 
frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures 
on the walls and the bed’s headboard; a spider’s web 
stretched between the chandelier and the top of the 
large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper 
into the room, he heard a scurrying of disturbed mice. 

The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so 
many posters and pictures that little of the walls’ 
silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume 
that Sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the 
Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the 
wall, because he was sure they would not have 
appreciated their eldest son’s taste in decoration. 
Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way to annoy 
his parents. There were several large Gryffindor 
banners, faded scarlet and gold, just to underline his 
difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. 
There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and 
also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several 
posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell 
that they were Muggles because they remained quite 
stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and 
glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast 
to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls, which 
Page | 200 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm 
in arm, laughing at the camera. 



With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father; 
his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like 
Harry’s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was 
Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face 
so much younger and happier than Harry had ever 
seen it alive. To Sirius’s right stood Pettigrew, more 
than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed 
with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, 
with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius 
had been. On James’s left was Lupin, even then a 
little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of 
delighted surprise at finding himself liked and 
included ... or was it simply because Harry knew how 
it had been, that he saw these things in the picture? 
He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after 
all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not 
budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his 
parents from redecorating his room. 

Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was 
growing brighter: A shaft of light revealed bits of 
paper, books, and small objects scattered over the 
carpet. Evidently Sirius’s bedroom had been searched 
too, although its contents seemed to have been 
judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the 
books had been shaken roughly enough to part 
company with their covers, and sundry pages littered 
the floor. 

Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of 
paper, and examined them. He recognized one as part 
of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda 
Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle 
maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and 
crumpled. He smoothed it out.

Dear Padfoot, 



Thank you, thank you, for Harry’s birthday present! It 
was his favorite by far. One year old and already 
zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so 
pleased with himself, I’m enclosing a picture so you 
can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the 
ground, but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a 
horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no 
complaints there). Of course, James thought it was so 
funny, says he’s going to be a great Quidditch player, 
but we’ve had to pack away all the ornaments and 
make sure we don’t take our eyes off him when he gets 
going. 

We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old 
Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us and who 
dotes on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn’t come, 
but the Order’s got to come first, and Harry’s not old 
enough to know it’s his birthday anyway! James is 
getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to 
show it but I can tell — also, Dumbledore’s still got his 
Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If 
you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy 
was here last weekend, I thought he seemed down, 
but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; 

I cried all evening when I heard. 

Bathilda drops in most days, she’s a fascinating old 
thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, 
I’m not sure he’d be pleased if he knew! I don’t know 
how much to believe, actually, because it seems 
incredible that Dumbledore 

Harry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He 
stood quite still, holding the miraculous paper in his 
nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet 
eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal 

Page | 202 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he 
sat down. 



He read the letter again, but could not take in any 
more meaning than he had done the first time, and 
was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She 
had made her “g”s the same way he did: He searched 
through the letter for every one of them, and each felt 
like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. 
The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily 
Potter had lived, really lived, that her warm hand had 
once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into 
these letters, these words, words about him, Harry, 
her son. 

Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he 
reread the letter, this time concentrating on the 
meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered 
voice. 

They had had a cat . . . perhaps it had perished, like 
his parents, at Godric’s Hollow ... or else fled when 
there was nobody left to feed it. ... Sirius had bought 
him his first broomstick. . . . His parents had known 
Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced them? 
DumblecLore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak ... There 
was something funny there. ... 

Harry paused, pondering his mother’s words. Why 
had Dumbledore taken James’s Invisibility Cloak? 
Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling 
him years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become 
invisible.” Perhaps some less gifted Order member 
had needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted 
as carrier? Harry passed on. ... 

Wormy was here . . . Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed 
“down,” had he? Was he aware that he was seeing 
James and Lily alive for the last time? 

Page | 203 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories 
about Dumbledore. It seems incredible that 
Dumbledore — 

That Dumbledore what? But there were any number 
of things that would seem incredible about 
Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks 
in a Transfiguration test, for instance, or had taken 
up goat-charming like Aberforth. ... 

Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps 
the rest of the letter was here somewhere. He seized 
papers, treating them, in his eagerness, with as little 
consideration as the original searcher; he pulled open 
drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his 
hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under 
the bed and armchair. 

At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what 
looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of 
drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most 
of the photograph Lily had described in her letter. A 
black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the 
picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a 
pair of legs that must have belonged to James was 
chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into 
his pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to look for 
the second sheet. 

After another quarter of an hour, however, he was 
forced to conclude that the rest of his mother’s letter 
was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years 
that had elapsed since it had been written, or had it 
been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry 
read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues 
as to what might have made the second sheet 
valuable. His toy broomstick could hardly be 
considered interesting to the Death Eaters. ... The 
only potentially useful thing he could see here was 
Page | 204 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




possible information on Dumbledore. It seems 
incredible that Dumbledore — what? 

“Harry? Harry! HarryV’ 

“I’m here!” he called. “What’s happened?” 

There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and 
Hermione burst inside. 

“We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she 
said breathlessly. She turned and shouted over her 
shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found him!” 

Ron’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several 
floors below. 

“Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!” 

“Harry, don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified! 
Why did you come up here anyway?” She gazed 
around the ransacked room. “What have you been 
doing?” 

“Look what I’ve just found.” 

He held out his mother’s letter. Hermione took it and 
read it while Harry watched her. When she reached 
the end of the page she looked up at him. 

“Oh, Harry ...” 

“And there’s this too.” 

He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione 
smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the 
toy broom. 



Page | 205 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry 
said, “but it’s not here.” 

Hermione glanced around. 

“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done 
when you got here?” 

“Someone had searched before me,” said Harry. 

“I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up 
had been disturbed. What were they after, do you 
think?” 

“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.” 

“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I 
mean, he was in the Order, wasn’t he?” 

“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, 
“what about information on Dumbledore? The second 
page of this letter, for instance. You know this 
Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?” 

“Who?” 

“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of — ” 

“A History of Magic,” said Hermione, looking 
interested. “So your parents knew her? She was an 
incredible magical historian.” 

“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in 
Godric’s Hollow, Ron’s Auntie Muriel was talking 
about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore ’s 
family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t 
she?” 



Page | 206 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There was a little too much understanding in the 
smile Hermione gave him for Harry’s liking. He took 
back the letter and the photograph and tucked them 
inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have 
to look at her and give himself away. 

“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about your 
mum and dad, and Dumbledore too,” said Hermione. 
“But that wouldn’t really help us in our search for the 
Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did not answer, and she 
rushed on, “Harry, I know you really want to go to 
Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared, I’m scared at how 
easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just 
makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid 
the place where your parents are buried, I’m sure 
they’d be expecting you to visit it.” 

“It’s not just that,” Harry said, still avoiding looking at 
her. “Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the 
wedding. I want to know the truth. ...” 

He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told 
him. When he had finished, Hermione said, “Of 
course, I can see why that’s upset you, Harry — ” 

“I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether 
or not it’s true or — ” 

“Harry, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a 
malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita 
Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew 
Dumbledore!” 

“I thought I did,” he muttered. 

“But you know how much truth there was in 
everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, how 
can you let these people tarnish your memories of 
Dumbledore?” 

Page | 207 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment 
he felt. There it was again: Choose what to believe. He 
wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined 
that he should not get it? 

“Shall we go down to the kitchen?” Hermione 
suggested after a little pause. “Find something for 
breakfast?” 

He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto 
the landing and past the second door that led off it. 
There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork 
below a small sign that he had not noticed in the 
dark. He paused at the top of the stairs to read it. It 
was a pompous little sign, neatly lettered by hand, 
the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck 
on his bedroom door: 

Do Not Enter 

Without the Express Permission of 
Regulus Arcturus Black 

Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not 
immediately sure why. He read the sign again. 
Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him. 

“Hermione,” he said, and he was surprised that his 
voice was so calm. “Come back up here.” 

“What’s the matter?” 

“R.A.B. I think I’ve found him.” 

There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up 
the stairs. 

“In your mum’s letter? But I didn’t see — ” 

Page | 208 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus’s sign. She 
read it, then clutched Harry’s arm so tightly that he 
winced. 

“Sirius’s brother?” she whispered. 

“He was a Death Eater,” said Harry, “Sirius told me 
about him, he joined up when he was really young 
and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they 
killed him.” 

“That fits!” gasped Hermione. “If he was a Death Eater 
he had access to Voldemort, and if he became 
disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring 
Voldemort down!” 

She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and 
screamed, “Ron! RON! Get up here, quick!” 

Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand 
ready in his hand. 

“What’s up? If it’s massive spiders again I want 
breakfast before I — ” 

He frowned at the sign on Regulus’s door, to which 
Hermione was silently pointing. 

“What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus 
Arcturus ... Regulus ... R.A.B.l The locket — you don’t 
reckon — ?” 

“Let’s find out,” said Harry. He pushed the door: It 
was locked. Hermione pointed her wand at the handle 
and said, “Alohomora.” There was a click, and the 
door swung open. 

They moved over the threshold together, gazing 
around. Regulus’s bedroom was slightly smaller than 

Page | 209 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Sirius’s, though it had the same sense of former 
grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his 
difference from the rest of the family, Regulus had 
striven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin 
colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping 
the bed, the walls, and the windows. The Black family 
crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along 
with its motto, TOU JOURS PUR. Beneath this was a 
collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck 
together to make a ragged collage. Hermione crossed 
the room to examine them. 

“They’re all about Voldemort,” she said. “Regulus 
seems to have been a fan for a few years before he 
joined the Death Eaters. ...” 

A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat 
down to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had 
noticed another photograph; a Hogwarts Quidditch 
team was smiling and waving out of the frame. He 
moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on 
their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly 
recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the 
front row: He had the same dark hair and slightly 
haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, 
slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had 
been. 

“He played Seeker,” said Harry. 

“What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still 
immersed in Voldemort’s press clippings. 

“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s 
where the Seeker ... Never mind,” said Harry, realizing 
that nobody was listening: Ron was on his hands and 
knees, searching under the wardrobe. Harry looked 
around the room for likely hiding places and 
approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had 
Page | 210 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




searched before them. The drawers’ contents had 
been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, but 
there was nothing of value there: old quills, out-of- 
date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly 
handled, a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky 
residue covering the contents of the drawer. 

“There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry 
wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. She raised her 
wand and said, “Accio Locked.” 

Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the 
folds of the faded curtains, looked disappointed. 

“Is that it, then? It’s not here?” 

“Oh, it could still be here, but under counter- 
enchantments,” said Hermione. “Charms to prevent it 
being summoned magically, you know.” 

“Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” 
said Harry, remembering how he had been unable to 
Summon the fake locket. 

“How are we supposed to find it then?” asked Ron. 

“We search manually,” said Hermione. 

“That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he 
resumed his examination of the curtains. 

They combed every inch of the room for more than an 
hour, but were forced, finally, to conclude that the 
locket was not there. 

The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even 
through the grimy landing windows. 



Page | 211 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” 
said Hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back 
downstairs: As Harry and Ron had become more 
discouraged, she seemed to have become more 
determined. “Whether he’d managed to destroy it or 
not, he’d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, 
wouldn’t he? Remember all those awful things we had 
to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock 
that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that 
tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them 
there to protect the locket’s hiding place, even though 
we didn’t realize it at ... at ...” 

Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with 
one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck look of one 
who had just been Obliviated; her eyes had even 
drifted out of focus. 

"... at the time,” she finished in a whisper. 

“Something wrong?” asked Ron. 

“There was a locket.” 

“What?” said Harry and Ron together. 

“In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could 
open it. And we ... we ...” 

Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through 
his chest into his stomach. He remembered: He had 
even handled the thing as they passed it around, each 
trying in turn to prise it open. It had been tossed into 
a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap 
powder and the music box that had made everyone 
sleepy. ... 

“Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,” said 
Harry. It was the only chance, the only slender hope

left to them, and he was going to cling to it until 
forced to let go. “He had a whole stash of stuff in his 
cupboard in the kitchen. C’mon.” 

He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the 
other two thundering along in his wake. They made 
so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius’s 
mother as they passed through the hall. 

“Filth). Mudbloods\ Scum)” she screamed after them as 
they dashed down into the basement kitchen and 
slammed the door behind them. 

Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at 
the door of Kreacher’s cupboard, and wrenched it 
open. There was the nest of dirty old blankets in 
which the house-elf had once slept, but they were no 
longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had 
salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of 
Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to 
believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and 
shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled 
dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw 
himself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed her 
eyes. 

“It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice 
and called, “ Kreacherl” 

There was a loud crack and the house-elf that Harry 
had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out 
of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: 
tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him 
in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his 
batlike ears. He was still wearing the filthy rag in 
which they had first met him, and the contemptuous 
look he bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to 
his change of ownership had altered no more than his 
outfit. 

Page | 213 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and 
he bowed low, muttering to his knees, “back in my 
Mistress’s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley 
and the Mudblood — ” 

“I forbid you to call anyone ‘blood traitor’ or 
‘Mudblood,’ ” growled Harry. He would have found 
Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, 
a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not 
betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. 

“I’ve got a question for you,” said Harry, his heart 
beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf, “and 
I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?” 

“Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry 
saw his lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing 
the insults he was now forbidden to utter. 

“Two years ago,” said Harry, his heart now 
hammering against his ribs, “there was a big gold 
locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. 
Did you steal it back?” 

There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher 
straightened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he 
said, “Yes.” 

“Where is it now?” asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and 
Hermione looked gleeful. 

Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear 
to see their reactions to his next word. 

“Gone.” 

“Gone?” echoed Harry, elation flooding out of him. 
“What do you mean, it’s gone?” 



Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The elf shivered. He swayed. 



“Kreacher,” said Harry fiercely, “I order you — ” 

“Mundungus Fletcher,” croaked the elf, his eyes still 
tight shut. “Mundungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss 
Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s pictures, my Mistress’s 
gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets 
with the family crest, and — and — ” 

Kreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was 
rising and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew open and 
he uttered a bloodcurdling scream. 

“ — and the locket, Master Regulus’s locket, Kreacher 
did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!” 

Harry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for 
the poker standing in the grate, he launched himself 
upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione’s scream 
mingled with Kreacher’s, but Harry bellowed louder 
than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay 
still!” 

He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay 
flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing from his 
sagging eyes. 

“Harry, let him up!” Hermione whispered. 

“So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted 
Harry, kneeling beside the elf. “I don’t think so. Right, 
Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know 
Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?” 

“Kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured 
over his snout and into his mouth full of graying 
teeth. “Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher’s 
cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher’s treasures. 

Page | 215 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus 
Fletcher laughed and r-ran. ...” 

“You called the locket ‘Master Regulus ’s,’ ” said Harry. 
“Why? Where did it come from? What did Regulus 
have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me 
everything you know about that locket, and 
everything Regulus had to do with it!” 

The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face 
between his knees, and began to rock backward and 
forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but 
quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen. 

“Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a 
bad boy and broke my Mistress’s heart with his 
lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper pride; 
he knew what was due to the name of Black and the 
dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the 
Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of 
hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . 
and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus 
joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to 
serve ... 

“And one day, a year after he had joined, Master 
Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. 
Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master 
Regulus said ... he said ...” 

The old elf rocked faster than ever. 

"... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.” 

“Voldemort needed an elf?” Harry repeated, looking 
around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as 
puzzled as he did. 



Page | 216 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh yes,” moaned Kreacher. “And Master Regulus had 
volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master 
Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who 
must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered 
him to do ... and then to c-come home.” 

Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in 
sobs. 

“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord 
did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took 
Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And 
beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the 
cavern was a great black lake ...” 

The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up. 
Kreacher’s croaking voice seemed to come to him from 
across that dark water. He saw what had happened 
as clearly as though he had been present. 

"... There was a boat ...” 

Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the 
boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry 
one wizard and one victim toward the island in the 
center. This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the 
defenses surrounding the Horcrux: by borrowing a 
disposable creature, a house-elf ... 

“There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The 
D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it. ...” 

The elf quaked from head to foot. 

“Kreacher drank, and as he drank, he saw terrible 
things. ... Kreacher’s insides burned. ... Kreacher 
cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his 
Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed. ... 

He made Kreacher drink all the potion. ... He dropped 
Page | 217 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




a locket into the empty basin. ... He filled it with more 
potion. 

“And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving 
Kreacher on the island. ...” 

Harry could see it happening. He watched 
Voldemort’s white, snakelike face vanishing into 
darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the 
thrashing elf whose death would occur within 
minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate 
thirst that the burning potion caused its victim. ... 

But here, Harry’s imagination could go no further, for 
he could not see how Kreacher had escaped. 

“Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s 
edge and he drank from the black lake ... and hands, 
dead hands, came out of the water and dragged 
Kreacher under the surface. ...” 

“How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not 
surprised to hear himself whispering. 

Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Harry 
with his great, bloodshot eyes. 

“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he 
said. 

“I know — but how did you escape the Inferi?” 

Kreacher did not seem to understand. 

“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he 
repeated. 

“I know, but — ” 



Page | 218 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, Harry?” said Ron. “He 
Disapparated!” 

“But ... you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that 
cave,” said Harry, “otherwise Dumbledore — ” 

“Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said Ron. “I 
mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out 
of Hogwarts when we can’t.” 

There was silence as Harry digested this. How could 
Voldemort have made such a mistake? But even as he 
thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy. 

“Of course, Voldemort would have considered the 
ways of house-elves far beneath his notice, just like 
all the purebloods who treat them like animals. ... It 
would never have occurred to him that they might 
have magic that he didn’t.” 

“The house-elf’s highest law is his Master’s bidding,” 
intoned Kreacher. “Kreacher was told to come home, 
so Kreacher came home. ...” 

“Well, then, you did what you were told, didn’t you?” 
said Hermione kindly. “You didn’t disobey orders at 
all!” 

Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever. 

“So what happened when you got back?” Harry asked. 
“What did Regulus say when you told him what had 
happened?” 

“Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,” 
croaked Kreacher. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to 
stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then ... it 
was a little while later . . . Master Regulus came to find 
Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master 
Page | 219 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, 
disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell . . . and he 
asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave 
where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. ...” 

And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them 
quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark 
Seeker who had so resembled Sirius. ... Kreacher 
knew how to open the concealed entrance to the 
underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat; 
this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with 
him to the island with its basin of poison. ... 

“And he made you drink the potion?” said Harry, 
disgusted. 

But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione’s 
hands leapt to her mouth: She seemed to have 
understood something. 

“M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like 
the one the Dark Lord had,” said Kreacher, tears 
pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. “And 
he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was 
empty, to switch the lockets. ...” 

Kreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had 
to concentrate hard to understand him. 

“And he ordered — Kreacher to leave — without him. 
And he told Kreacher — to go home — and never to 
tell my Mistress — what he had done — but to 
destroy — the first locket. And he drank — all the 
potion — and Kreacher swapped the lockets — and 
watched ... as Master Regulus . . . was dragged 
beneath the water ... and ...” 

“Oh, Kreacher!” wailed Hermione, who was crying. 

She dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to 

Page | 220 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away 
from her, quite obviously repulsed. 

“The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, 
what would his Mistress say?” 

“I told you not to call her ‘Mudblood’!” snarled Harry, 
but the elf was already punishing himself: He fell to 
the ground and banged his forehead on the floor. 

“Stop him — stop him!” Hermione cried. “Oh, don’t 
you see now how sick it is, the way they’ve got to 
obey?” 

“Kreacher — stop, stop!” shouted Harry. 

The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green 
mucus glistening around his snout, a bruise already 
blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck 
himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and 
swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so 
pitiful. 

“So you brought the locket home,” he said 
relentlessly, for he was determined to know the full 
story. “And you tried to destroy it?” 

“Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,” 
moaned the elf. “Kreacher tried everything, everything 
he knew, but nothing, nothing would work. ... So 
many powerful spells upon the casing, Kreacher was 
sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it 
would not open. . . . Kreacher punished himself, he 
tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. 
Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not 
destroy the locket! And his Mistress was mad with 
grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and 
Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, 



Page | 221 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell 
any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave. ...” 

Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no 
more coherent words. Tears flowed down Hermione’s 
cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare 
touch him again. Even Ron, who was no fan of 
Kreacher’s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his 
heels and shook his head, trying to clear it. 

“I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said finally. 
“Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring 
Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray 
Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to 
Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to 
Voldemort through them. ...” 

“Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said 
Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. 
“He’s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even 
brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher 
wasn’t that far out of the common way. What do 
wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He’s loyal 
to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must 
have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served 
them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what 
you’re going to say,” she went on as Harry began to 
protest, “that Regulus changed his mind . . . but he 
doesn’t seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does 
he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus ’s 
family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood 
line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.” 

“Sirius — ” 

“Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it’s no 
good looking like that, you know it’s true. Kreacher 
had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to 
live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of 

Page | 222 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




affection. I’m sure ‘Miss Cissy’ and ‘Miss Bella’ were 
perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he 
did them a favor and told them everything they 
wanted to know. I’ve said all along that wizards would 
pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort 
did ... and so did Sirius.” 

Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing 
on the floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had 
said to him, mere hours after Sirius’s death: I do not 
think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings 
as acute as a human’s. ... 

“Kreacher,” said Harry after a while, “when you feel 
up to it, er ... please sit up.” 

It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped 
himself into silence. Then he pushed himself into a 
sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his 
eyes like a small child. 

“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” 
said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for assistance. He 
wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, 
he could not pretend that it was not an order. 
However, the change in his tone seemed to have 
gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly. 

“Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find 
Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where the 
locket — where Master Regulus’s locket is. It’s really 
important. We want to finish the work Master 
Regulus started, we want to — er — ensure that he 
didn’t die in vain.” 

Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry. 
“Find Mundungus Fletcher?” he croaked. 



Page | 223 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,” said 
Harry. “Do you think you could do that for us?” 

As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a 
sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid’s purse and 
took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in 
which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort. 

“Kreacher, I’d, er, like you to have this,” he said, 
pressing the locket into the elf’s hand. “This belonged 
to Regulus and I’m sure he’d want you to have it as a 
token of gratitude for what you — ” 

“Overkill, mate,” said Ron as the elf took one look at 
the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery, and 
threw himself back onto the ground. 

It took them nearly half an hour to calm down 
Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented with 
a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was 
too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally 
he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied 
him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket 
safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that 
they would make its protection their first priority 
while he was away. He then made two low bows to 
Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in 
Hermione’s direction that might have been an attempt 
at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the 
usual loud crack. 



Page | 224 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE BRIBE 

If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry 
was confident that the capture of Mundungus would 
take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house 
all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, 
Kreacher did not return that morning or even that 
afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and 
anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy 
bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of 
unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help. 

Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day 
after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in 
the square outside number twelve, and they remained 
there into the night, gazing in the direction of the 
house that they could not see. 

“Death Eaters, for sure,” said Ron, as he, Harry, and 
Hermione watched from the drawing room windows. 
“Reckon they know we’re in here?” 



Page | 225 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“I don’t think so,” said Hermione, though she looked 
frightened, “or they’d have sent Snape in after us, 
wouldn’t they?” 

“D’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue 
tied by Moody’s curse?” asked Ron. 

“Yes,” said Hermione, “otherwise he’d have been able 
to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re 
probably watching to see whether we turn up. They 
know that Harry owns the house, after all.” 

“How do they — ?” began Harry. 

“Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, 
remember? They’ll know Sirius left you the place.” 

The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased 
the ominous mood inside number twelve. They had 
not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld 
Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain 
was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had 
developed an annoying habit of playing with the 
Deluminator in his pocket: This particularly 
infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait 
for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard 
and did not appreciate the way the lights kept 
flashing on and off. 

“Will you stop it!” she cried on the third evening of 
Kreacher’s absence, as all light was sucked from the 
drawing room yet again. 

“Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and 
restoring the lights. “I don’t know I’m doing it!” 

“Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy 
yourself?” 



Page | 226 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What, like reading kids’ stories?” 

“Dumbledore left me this book, Ron — ” 

“ — and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m 
supposed to use it!” 

Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of 
the room unnoticed by either of them. He headed 
downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting 
because he was sure that was where Kreacher was 
most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of 
stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the 
front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the 
chain. 

Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled 
out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the 
decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: 
He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a 
cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door 
behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and 
Moody’s voice asked, “Severus Snape ?” Then the dust 
figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, 
raising its dead hand. 

“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice. 

The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it 
was impossible to make out the newcomer through 
the dense gray cloud it left behind. 

Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it. 

“Don’t move!” 

He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the 
sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open 



Page | 227 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and she began to scream, “Mudbloods and filth 
dishonoring my house — ” 

Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs 
behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the 
unknown man now standing with his arms raised in 
the hall below. 

“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!” 

“Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, 
pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, 
the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron 
too lowered his wand, but Harry did not. 

“Show yourself!” he called back. 

Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still 
held high in a gesture of surrender. 

“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known 
as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s 
Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as 
Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, 
Harry, which takes the form of a stag.” 

“Oh, all right,” said Harry, lowering his wand, “but I 
had to check, didn’t I?” 

“Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts 
teacher, I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, 
Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower 
your defenses.” 

They ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped in a 
thick black traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but 
pleased to see them. 

“No sign of Severus, then?” he asked. 

Page | 228 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry. “What’s going on? Is everyone 
okay?” 

“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There 
are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside — ” 

“We know — ” 

“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step 
outside the front door to be sure that they would not 
see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure 
they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out 
everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. 
Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I 
want to know what happened after you left the 
Burrow.” 

They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione 
pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang up 
instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark 
stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. 
Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his 
traveling cloak and they sat down. 

“I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to 
shake off the Death Eater tailing me,” said Lupin. “So, 
you came straight here after the wedding?” 

“No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of 
Death Eaters in a cafe on Tottenham Court Road.” 

Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. 

“ What ?” 

They explained what had happened; when they had 
finished, Lupin looked aghast. 



Page | 229 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible 
to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold 
of them as they disappear!” 

“And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling 
down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?” 
said Harry. 

“We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether 
Harry could still have the Trace on him?” 

“Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and 
Harry felt hugely relieved. “Apart from anything else, 
they’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the 
Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they 
could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, 
that’s worrying, really worrying.” 

He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was 
concerned, that question could wait. 

“Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard 
a thing since Ron’s dad told us the family were safe.” 

“Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his 
warning most of the wedding guests were able to 
Disapparate before they arrived.” 

“Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?” 
interjected Hermione. 

“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the 
same thing now,” said Lupin. “There were about a 
dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, 
Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture 
your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed 
him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.” 



Page | 230 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions 
reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He 
had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin 
said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to 
protect Harry. 

“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to 
bottom,” Lupin went on. “They found the ghoul, but 
didn’t want to get too close — and then they 
interrogated those of us who remained for hours. 

They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but 
of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you 
had been there. 

“At the same time that they were smashing up the 
wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way 
into every Order-connected house in the country. No 
deaths,” he added quickly, forestalling the question, 
“but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus 
Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and 
they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family. 
Again, trying to find out where you went after you 
visited them. They’re all right — shaken, obviously, 
but otherwise okay.” 

“The Death Eaters got through all those protective 
charms?” Harry asked, remembering how effective 
these had been on the night he had crashed in 
Tonks’s parents’ garden. 

“What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death 
Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their 
side now,” said Lupin. “They’ve got the power to 
perform brutal spells without fear of identification or 
arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive 
spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they 
were completely open about why they’d come.”

“And are they bothering to give an excuse for 
torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people?” asked 
Hermione, an edge to her voice. 

“Well,” said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a 
folded copy of the Daily Prophet 

“Here,” he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, 
“you’ll know sooner or later anyway. That’s their 
pretext for going after you.” 

Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of 
his own face filled the front page. He read the 
headline over it: 

WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT 

THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry 
said nothing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did 
not want to read any more: He knew what it would 
say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the 
tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really 
killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the 
Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from 
the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen. 

“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said. 

“So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet 
too?” asked Hermione furiously. 

Lupin nodded. 

“But surely people realize what’s going on?” 

“The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said 
Lupin. “The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is 

Page | 232 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius 
Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.” 

“Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of 
Magic?” asked Ron. 

Lupin laughed. 

“He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively he is the 
Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the 
Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of 
everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend 
his power beyond the Ministry. 

“Naturally many people have deduced what has 
happened: There has been such a dramatic change in 
Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are 
whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. 
However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren’t 
confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; 
they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions 
are true and their families are targeted. Yes, 

Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring 
himself might have provoked open rebellion: 
Remaining masked has created confusion, 
uncertainty, and fear.” 

“And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,” said 
Harry, “involves warning the Wizarding world against 
me instead of Voldemort?” 

“That’s certainly part of it,” said Lupin, “and it is a 
masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you — 
the Boy Who Lived — were sure to be the symbol and 
rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by 
suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero’s 
death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your 
head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who 
would have defended you. 

Page | 233 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against 
Muggle-borns.” 

Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet 
“Look at page two.” 

Hermione turned the pages with much the same 
expression of distaste she had worn when handling 
Secrets of the Darkest Art 

“ ‘Muggle-born Register,’ ” she read aloud. “ ‘The 
Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called 
“Muggle-borns,” the better to understand how they 
came to possess magical secrets. 

“ ‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of 
Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from 
person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no 
proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so- 
called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical 
power by theft or force. 

“ ‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers 
of magical power, and to this end has issued an 
invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present 
themselves for interview by the newly appointed 
Muggle-born Registration Commission.’ ” 

“People won’t let this happen,” said Ron. 

“It is happening, Ron,” said Lupin. “Muggle-borns are 
being rounded up as we speak.” 

“But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic?” 
said Ron. “It’s mental, if you could steal magic there 
wouldn’t be any Squibs, would there?” 



Page | 234 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I know,” said Lupin. “Nevertheless, unless you can 
prove that you have at least one close Wizarding 
relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your 
magical power illegally and must suffer the 
punishment.” 

Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, “What if 
purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s 
part of their family? I’ll tell everyone Hermione ’s my 
cousin — ” 

Hermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed 
it. 

“Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let you — ” 

“You won’t have a choice,” said Ron fiercely, gripping 
her hand back. “I’ll teach you my family tree so you 
can answer questions on it. 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh. 

“Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most 
wanted person in the country, I don’t think it matters. 
If I was going back to school it would be different. 
What’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?” she asked 
Lupin. 

“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch 
and wizard,” he replied. “That was announced 
yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never 
obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and 
wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but 
their parents had the right to teach them at home or 
send them abroad if they preferred. This way, 
Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population 
under his eye from a young age. And it’s also another 
way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students 
must be given Blood Status — meaning that they 
Page | 235 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard 
descent — before they are allowed to attend.” 

Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, 
excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks 
of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they 
would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their 
families again either. 

“It’s ... it’s ...” he muttered, struggling to find words 
that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but 
Lupin said quietly, 

“I know.” 

Lupin hesitated. 

“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but 
the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore 
left you a mission.” 

“He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are 
in on it and they’re coming with me.” 

“Can you confide in me what the mission is?” 

Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed 
in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could 
return a different answer. 

“I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell 
you I don’t think I can.” 

“I thought you’d say that,” said Lupin, looking 
disappointed. “But I might still be of some use to you. 
You know what I am and what I can do. I could come 
with you to provide protection. There would be no 
need to tell me exactly what you were up to.” 



Page | 236 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though 
how they would be able to keep their mission secret 
from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could 
not imagine. 

Hermione, however, looked puzzled. 

“But what about Tonks?” she asked. 

“What about her?” said Lupin. 

“Well,” said Hermione, frowning, “you’re married! How 
does she feel about you going away with us?” 

“Tonks will be perfectly safe,” said Lupin. “She’ll be at 
her parents’ house.” 

There was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was 
almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea 
of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents’ house; she 
was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as 
Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of 
the action. 

“Remus,” said Hermione tentatively, “is everything all 
right . . . you know . . . between you and — ” 

“Everything is fine, thank you,” said Lupin pointedly. 

Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an 
awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, 
with an air of forcing himself to admit something 
unpleasant, “Tonks is going to have a baby.” 

“Oh, how wonderful!” squealed Hermione. 

“Excellent!” said Ron enthusiastically. 

“Congratulations,” said Harry. 

Page | 237 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a 
grimace, then said, “So ... do you accept my offer? 

Will three become four? I cannot believe that 
Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed 
me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after 
all. And I must tell you that I believe that we are 
facing magic many of us have never encountered or 
imagined.” 

Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. 

“Just — just to be clear,” he said. “You want to leave 
Tonks at her parents’ house and come away with us?” 

“She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,” 
said Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on 
indifference. “Harry, I’m sure James would have 
wanted me to stick with you.” 

“Well,” said Harry slowly, “I’m not. I’m pretty sure my 
father would have wanted to know why you aren’t 
sticking with your own kid, actually.” 

Lupin’s face drained of color. The temperature in the 
kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared 
around the room as though he had been bidden to 
memorize it, while Hermione ’s eyes swiveled 
backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. 

“You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last. 

“Explain, then,” said Harry. 

Lupin swallowed. 

“I — I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did 
it against my better judgment and I have regretted it 
very much ever since.” 



Page | 238 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I see,” said Harry, “so you’re just going to dump her 
and the kid and run off with us?” 

Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over 
backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that 
Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the 
wolf upon his human face. 

“Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and 
my unborn child? I should never have married her, 
I’ve made her an outcast!” 

Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. 

“You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or 
under Dumbledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You 
don’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees 
creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, 
they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve 
done? Even her own family is disgusted by our 
marriage, what parents want their only daughter to 
marry a werewolf? And the child — the child — ” 

Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he 
looked quite deranged. 

“My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am 
convinced of it — how can I forgive myself, when I 
knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an 
innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like 
me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, 
without a father of whom it must always be 
ashamed!” 

“Remus!” whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. 
“Don’t say that — how could any child be ashamed of 
you?” 



Page | 239 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,” said Harry. “I’d be 
pretty ashamed of him.” 

Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, 
but it had propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked 
as though Harry had hit him. 

“If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,” 
Harry said, “what will they do to a half-werewolf 
whose father’s in the Order? My father died trying to 
protect my mother and me, and you reckon he’d tell 
you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with 
us?” 

“How — how dare you?” said Lupin. “This is not about 
a desire for — for danger or personal glory — how 
dare you suggest such a — ” 

“I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil,” Harry said. 
“You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoes — ” 

“Harry, no!” Hermione begged him, but he continued 
to glare into Lupin’s livid face. 

“I’d never have believed this,” Harry said. “The man 
who taught me to fight dementors — a coward.” 

Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely 
reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he 
felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he 
slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he 
glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing 
around the door. 

“Remus, Remus, come back!” Hermione cried, but 
Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the 
front door slam. 

“Harry!” wailed Hermione. “How could you?” 

Page | 240 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It was easy,” said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a 
lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He 
was still so full of anger he was shaking. 

“Don’t look at me like that!” he snapped at Hermione. 

“Don’t you start on her!” snarled Ron. 

“No — no — we mustn’t fight!” said Hermione, 
launching herself between them. 

“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” Ron 
told Harry. 

“He had it coming to him,” said Harry. Broken images 
were racing each other through his mind: Sirius 
falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, 
broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his 
mother’s voice, begging for mercy ... 

“Parents,” said Harry, “shouldn’t leave their kids 
unless — unless they’ve got to.” 

“Harry — ” said Hermione, stretching out a consoling 
hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his 
eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once 
spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking 
reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled 
him. Now Lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim 
in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of 
remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry 
felt sure that they were looking at each other behind 
his back, communicating silently. 

He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly 
away from each other. 

“I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.” 



Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No, you shouldn’t,” said Ron at once. 



“But he’s acting like one.” 

“All the same ...” said Hermione. 

“I know,” said Harry. “But if it makes him go back to 
Tonks, it’ll be worth it, won’t it?” 

He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione 
looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked 
down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James 
have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or 
would he have been angry at how his son had treated 
his old friend? 

The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of 
the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione ’s 
unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had 
brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own face 
staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He 
walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at 
random, and pretended to read. He could not take in 
the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter 
with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had 
resumed their silent communications on the other 
side of the Prophet He turned a page loudly, and 
Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a 
moment or two before he took in the meaning of the 
photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath 
the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore 
family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn 
Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth. 

His attention caught, Harry examined the picture 
more carefully. Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a 
good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle 
even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, 
was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more 
Page | 242 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet-black 
hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved 
quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native 
Americans he’d seen as he studied her dark eyes, 
high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally 
composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and 
Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and 
had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus 
looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys 
looked very alike, for this was before Albus ’s nose had 
been broken and before he started wearing glasses. 

The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling 
serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby Ariana’s arm 
waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above 
the picture and saw the headline: 

EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING 
BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

by Rita Skeeter 

Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse 
than he already did, Harry began to read: 

Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not 
bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her 
husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and 
imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to 
uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the 
village that was later to gain fame as the scene of 
Harry Potter’s strange escape from You-Know-Who. 

Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric’s Hollow was home to 
a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew 
none of them, she would be spared the curiosity 
about her husband’s crime she had faced in her 
former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly 



Page | 243 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon 
ensured that her family was left well alone. 

“Slammed the door in my face when I went around to 
welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron 
Cakes,” says Bathilda Bagshot. “The first year they 
were there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn’t 
have known there was a daughter if I hadn’t been 
picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they 
moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the 
back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping 
a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn’t 
know what to make of it. ” 

It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric’s 
Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana 
once and for all, something she had probably been 
planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana 
was barely seven years old when she vanished from 
sight, and seven is the age by which most experts 
agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. 
Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever 
demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical 
ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a 
decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than 
suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced 
a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors 
who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning 
her all the easier. The tiny number of people who 
henceforth knew of Ariana’s existence could be 
counted upon to keep the secret, including her two 
brothers, who deflected awkward questions with the 
answer their mother had taught them: “My sister is 
too frail for school.” 

Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts — the 
Prizes and the Pretense. 



Page | 244 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed 
made him feel worse. He looked back at the 
photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it 
true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to 
Godric’s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to 
talk to him; he wanted to visit the place where he and 
Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the 
process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron’s and 
Hermione’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed 
around the kitchen. 

For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all 
about Kreacher. His immediate thought was that 
Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split 
second, he did not take in the mass of struggling 
limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside 
his chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher 
disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, 
croaked, “Kreacher has returned with the thief 
Mundungus Fletcher, Master.” 

Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; 
Hermione, however, was too quick for him. 

“Expelliarmusl” 

Mundungus ’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione 
caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: 
Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone 
floor with a muffled crunch. 

“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free 
himself from Ron’s grip. “Wha’ve I done? Setting a 
bleedin’ ’ouse-elf on me, what are you playing at, 
wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, or — ” 

“You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” 
said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, crossed 
the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees 

Page | 245 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and 
looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as 
Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus ’s 
nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco 
smoke: His hair was matted and his robes stained. 

“Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the 
thief, Master,” croaked the elf. “Fletcher knows how to 
avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and 
accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the 
thief in the end.” 

“You’ve done really well, Kreacher,” said Harry, and 
the elf bowed low. 

“Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry told 
Mundungus, who shouted at once, 

“I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no 
offense, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, 
an’ that was bleedin’ You-Know-Who come flying at 
me, anyone woulda got outta there, I said all along I 
didn’t wanna do it — ” 

“For your information, none of the rest of us 
Disapparated,” said Hermione. 

“Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ’eroes then, aren’t 
you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself 



“We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad- 
Eye,” said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to 
Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes. “We already 
knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.” 

“Well then, why the ’ell am I being ’unted down by 
’ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets again? I 
ain’t got none of ’em left, or you could ’ave ’em — ” 

Page | 246 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re 
getting warmer,” said Harry. “Shut up and listen.” 

It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of 
whom he could demand some small portion of truth. 
Harry’s wand was now so close to the bridge of 
Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had gone cross- 
eyed trying to keep it in view. 

“When you cleaned out this house of anything 
valuable,” Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted 
him again. 

“Sirius never cared about any of the junk — ” 

There was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of 
shining copper, an echoing clang, and a shriek of 
agony: Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and 
hit him over the head with a saucepan. 

“Call ’im off, call ’im off, ’e should be locked up!” 
screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised 
the heavy-bottomed pan again. 

“Kreacher, no!” shouted Harry. 

Kreacher’s thin arms trembled with the weight of the 
pan, still held aloft. 

“Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?” 

Ron laughed. 

“We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs 
persuading you can do the honors,” said Harry. 

“Thank you very much, Master,” said Kreacher with a 
bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great pale 
eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. 

Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“When you stripped this house of all the valuables 
you could find,” Harry began again, “you took a 
bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was 
a locket there.” Harry’s mouth was suddenly dry: He 
could sense Ron and Hermione’s tension and 
excitement too. “What did you do with it?” 

“Why?” asked Mundungus. “Is it valuable?” 

“You’ve still got it!” cried Hermione. 

“No, he hasn’t,” said Ron shrewdly. “He’s wondering 
whether he should have asked more money for it.” 

“More?” said Mundungus. “That wouldn’t have been 
effing difficult ... bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I? No 
choice.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me 
and asks if I’ve got a license for trading in magical 
artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop. She was gonna fine me, but 
she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me she’d take it 
and let me off that time, and to fink meself lucky.” 

“Who was this woman?” asked Harry. 

“I dunno, some Ministry hag.” 

Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. 

“Little woman. Bow on top of ’er head.” 

He frowned and then added, “Looked like a toad.” 

Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the 
nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which 
ignited. 

Page | 248 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Aguamenti\” screamed Hermione, and a jet of water 
streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and 
choking Mundungus. 

Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in 
Ron’s and Hermione’s faces. The scars on the back of 
his right hand seemed to be tingling again.

MAGIC IS MIGHT 

As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in 
the middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun 
until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of 
number twelve were never seen by anybody in the 
surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve 
itself. The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had 
long since accepted the amusing mistake in the 
numbering that had caused number eleven to sit 
beside number thirteen. 

And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of 
visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most 
intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two 
people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other 
purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the 
railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching 
the join between the two houses. The lurkers were 
never the same two days running, although they all 
seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of 
the Londoners who passed them were used to 
eccentric dressers and took little notice, though 
occasionally one of them might glance back, 

Page | 250 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks 
in this heat. 

The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction 
from their vigil. Occasionally one of them started 
forward excitedly, as if they had seen something 
interesting at last, only to fall back looking 
disappointed. 

On the first day of September there were more people 
lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen 
men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing 
as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing 
for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As 
evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust 
of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there 
occurred one of those inexplicable moments when 
they appeared to have seen something interesting. 

The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest 
companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but 
a moment later they had relaxed into their previous 
state of inactivity, looking frustrated and 
disappointed. 

Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just 
entered the hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he 
Apparated onto the top step just outside the front 
door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have 
caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. 
Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he 
pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his 
arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward 
the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the 
Daily Prophet clutched in his hand. 

The usual low whisper of “Severus Snape?” greeted 
him, the chill wind swept him, and his tongue rolled 
up for a moment.

“I didn’t kill you,” he said, once it had unrolled, then 
held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. He 
waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the 
kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the 
dust cloud, before calling, “I’ve got news, and you 
won’t like it.” 

The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface 
now shone: Copper pots and pans had been 
burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop 
gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for 
dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, 
on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the 
room, however, was more dramatically different than 
the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, 
dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean 
and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus’s locket bouncing 
on his thin chest. 

“Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands 
washed before dinner,” croaked Kreacher, seizing the 
Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a 
hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned 
robes that had been freshly laundered. 

“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He 
and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf of 
scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered 
the end of the long kitchen table, but now they 
watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw 
down the newspaper on top of their scattered 
parchment. 

A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired 
man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that 
read: 

SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS 
HEADMASTER 

Page | 252 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly. 

Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the 
newspaper and began to read the accompanying story 
out loud. 

“ ‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was 
today appointed headmaster in the most important of 
several staffing changes at the ancient school. 
Following the resignation of the previous Muggle 
Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post 
while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense 
Against the Dark Arts professor. 

“ 7 welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest 
Wizarding traditions and values — ’ Like committing 
murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose! 

Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — 
Merlin’s pants!” she shrieked, making both Harry and 
Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled 
from the room, shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a 
minute!” 

“ ‘Merlin’s pants?” repeated Ron, looking amused. 
“She must be upset.” He pulled the newspaper toward 
him and perused the article about Snape. 

“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall 
and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they 
know how Dumbledore died. They won’t accept Snape 
as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?” 

“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of 
them inside. They were at the top of the tower when 
Snape killed Dumbledore, so it’s all friends together. 
And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, “I 
can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice 
but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind 
Page | 253 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Snape it’ll be a choice between staying and teaching, 
or a nice few years in Azkaban — and that’s if they’re 
lucky. I reckon they’ll stay to try and protect the 
students.” 

Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large 
tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine 
bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so. 

“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, flipping over the 
Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape ’s face. 

“Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.” 

He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality 
of Kreacher’s cooking had improved dramatically ever 
since he had been given Regulus’s locket: Today’s 
French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted. 

“There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the 
house,” he told Ron as he ate, “more than usual. It’s 
like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our 
school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.” 

Ron glanced at his watch. 

“I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six 
hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn’t it?” 

In his mind’s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet 
steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by 
air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling 
scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and 
Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps 
wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or 
debating how best to undermine Snape ’s new regime. 

“They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry 
said. “I landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak 
slipped.” 

Page | 254 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, 
craning around in his seat to watch Hermione 
reentering the kitchen. “And what in the name of 
Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?” 

“I remembered this,” Hermione panted. 

She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she 
now lowered to the floor before seizing her small, 
beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, 
she proceeded to force the painting inside, and 
despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit 
inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had 
vanished, like so much else, into the bag’s capacious 
depths. 

“Phineas Nigellus,” Hermione explained as she threw 
the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual 
sonorous, clanking crash. 

“Sorry?” said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted 
image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit 
between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one 
that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the 
circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt 
sitting right now, in triumphant possession of 
Dumbledore’s collection of delicate, silver magical 
instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, 
unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of 
Gryffindor. 

“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this 
house for him,” Hermione explained to Ron as she 
resumed her seat. “But let him try it now, all Phineas 
Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my 
handbag.” 

“Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed. 



Page | 255 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Thank you,” smiled Hermione, pulling her soup 
toward her. “So, Harry, what else happened today?” 

“Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance 
for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad, 
though, Ron. He looks fine.” 

Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had 
agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and 
communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in 
and out of the Ministry, because he was always 
surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, 
however, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, 
even if he did look very strained and anxious. 

“Dad always told us most Ministry people use the 
Floo Network to get to work,” Ron said. “That’s why 
we haven’t seen Umbridge, she’d never walk, she’d 
think she’s too important.” 

“And what about that funny old witch and that little 
wizard in the navy robes?” Hermione asked. 

“Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said 
Ron. 

“How do you know he works for Magical 
Maintenance?” Hermione asked, her soupspoon 
suspended in midair. 

“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears 
navy blue robes.” 

“But you never told us that!” 

Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her 
the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had 
been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen. 



Page | 256 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, 
nothing!” she said, flipping feverishly through the 
pages. 

“Well, does it really matter?” 

“Ron, it all matters! If we’re going to get into the 
Ministry and not give ourselves away when they’re 
bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little 
detail matters! We’ve been over and over this, I mean, 
what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if 
you aren’t even bothering to tell us — ” 

“Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing — ” 

“You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no 
more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be 
right now than the Ministry of — ” 

“I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry. 

Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked 
a little over his soup. 

“Tomorrow?” repeated Hermione. “You aren’t serious, 
Harry?” 

“I am,” said Harry. “I don’t think we’re going to be 
much better prepared than we are now even if we 
skulk around the Ministry entrance for another 
month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that 
locket could be. There’s already a good chance 
Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t 
open.” 

“Unless,” said Ron, “she’s found a way of opening it 
and she’s now possessed.” 



Page | 257 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Wouldn’t make any difference to her, she was so evil 
in the first place,” Harry shrugged. 

Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought. 

“We know everything important,” Harry went on, 
addressing Hermione. “We know they’ve stopped 
Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only 
the most senior Ministry members are allowed to 
connect their homes to the Floo Network now, 
because Ron heard those two Unspeakables 
complaining about it. And we know roughly where 
Umbridge’s office is, because of what you heard that 
bearded bloke saying to his mate — ” 

“ ‘I’ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,’ ” 
Hermione recited immediately. 

“Exactly,” said Harry. “And we know you get in using 
those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, 
because I saw that witch borrowing one from her 
friend — ” 

“But we haven’t got any!” 

“If the plan works, we will have,” Harry continued 
calmly. 

“I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know. ... There are an 
awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much 
relies on chance. ...” 

“That’ll be true even if we spend another three 
months preparing,” said Harry. “It’s time to act.” 

He could tell from Ron’s and Hermione’s faces that 
they were scared; he was not particularly confident 
himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to 
put their plan into operation. 

Page | 258 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in 
turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the 
official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to 
Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood. They had 
tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped 
on their conversations, and learned by careful 
observation which of them could be relied upon to 
appear, alone, at the same time every day. 
Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a 
Daily Prophet out of somebody’s briefcase. Slowly they 
had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked 
in front of Hermione. 

“All right,” said Ron slowly, “let’s say we go for it 
tomorrow. ... I think it should just be me and Harry.” 

“Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione. “I 
thought we’d settled this.” 

“It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under 
the Cloak, but this is different, Hermione.” Ron 
jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated 
ten days previously. “You’re on the list of Muggle- 
borns who didn’t present themselves for 
interrogation!” 

“And you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at 
the Burrow! If anyone shouldn’t go, it’s Harry, he’s got 
a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head — ” 

“Fine, I’ll stay here,” said Harry. “Let me know if you 
ever defeat Voldemort, won’t you?” 

As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the 
scar on Harry’s forehead. His hand jumped to it: He 
saw Hermione’s eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off 
the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes. 



Page | 259 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, if all three of us go well have to Disapparate 
separately,” Ron was saying. “We can’t all fit under 
the Cloak anymore.” 

Harry’s scar was becoming more and more painful. 

He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried forward. 

“Master has not finished his soup, would Master 
prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to 
which Master is so partial?” 

“Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute — er 
— bathroom.” 

Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, 
Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the 
first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and 
bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he 
slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form 
of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes. ... 

He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on 
either side of him had high, timbered gables; they 
looked like gingerbread houses. 

He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness 
of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He 
knocked. He felt a mounting excitement. ... 

The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her 
face fell as she looked into Harry’s face: humor gone, 
terror replacing it. ... 

“Gregorovitch?” said a high, cold voice. 

She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. 
A white hand held it steady, prevented her shutting 
him out. ... 



Page | 260 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I want Gregorovitch.” 

“Er wohnt hier nicht mehr\” she cried, shaking her 
head. “He no live here! He no live here! I know him 
not!” 

Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began 
to back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed, 
gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had 
drawn his wand. 

“Where is he?” 

“Das weifi ich nichti He move! I know not, I know not!” 

He raised the wand. She screamed. Two young 
children came running into the hall. She tried to 
shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green 
light — 

“Harry! HARRY!” 

He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. 
Hermione was pounding on the door again. 

“Harry, open up!” 

He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and 
unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, 
regained her balance, and looked around 
suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking 
unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of 
the chilly bathroom. 

“What were you doing?” asked Hermione sternly. 

“What d’you think I was doing?” asked Harry with 
feeble bravado. 



Page | 261 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You were yelling your head off!” said Ron. 

“Oh yeah ... I must’ve dozed off or — ” 

“Harry, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said 
Hermione, taking deep breaths. “We know your scar 
hurt downstairs, and you’re white as a sheet.” 

Harry sat down on the edge of the bath. 

“Fine. I’ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. 
By now he’s probably killed her whole family. And he 
didn’t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were 
just there. ...” 

“Harry, you aren’t supposed to let this happen 
anymore!” Hermione cried, her voice echoing through 
the bathroom. “Dumbledore wanted you to use 
Occlumency! He thought the connection was 
dangerous — Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good 
is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?” 

“Because it means I know what he’s doing,” said 
Harry. 

“So you’re not even going to try to shut him out?” 

“Hermione, I can’t. You know I’m lousy at 
Occlumency, I never got the hang of it.” 

“You never really tried!” she said hotly. “I don’t get it, 
Harry — do you like having this special connection or 
relationship or what — whatever — ” 

She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood 

up. 



“Like it?” he said quietly. “Would you like it?” 



Page | 262 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I — no — I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean — ” 

“I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, 
that I have to watch him when he’s most dangerous. 
But I’m going to use it.” 

“Dumbledore — ” 

“Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else’s. 
I want to know why he’s after Gregorovitch.” 

“Who?” 

“He’s a foreign wandmaker,” said Harry. “He made 
Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.” 

“But according to you,” said Ron, “Voldemort’s got 
Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he’s already got a 
wandmaker, what does he need another one for?” 

“Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks 
Gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks 
Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did 
when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn’t 
know.” 

Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw 
Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind 
his back. 

“Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,” 
said Hermione, “but you made it happen! Why are 
you so determined not to take responsibility for your 
own power?” 

“Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, 
Hermione! We both know what really happened!” 



Page | 263 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




They glared at each other: Harry knew that he had 
not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling 
counterarguments, against both his theory on his 
wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to 
see into Voldemort’s mind. To his relief, Ron 
intervened. 

“Drop it,” he advised her. “It’s up to him. And if we’re 
going to the Ministry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we 
should go over the plan?” 

Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let 
the matter rest, though Harry was quite sure she 
would attack again at the first opportunity. In the 
meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, 
where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart. 

They did not get to bed until late that night, after 
spending hours going over and over their plan until 
they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. 

Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius’s room, lay in 
bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph 
of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and 
muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. 
As he extinguished his wand, however, he was 
thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or 
the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he 
thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how 
long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort 
sought him so determinedly. 

Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste. 

“You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered 
the room to wake Harry. 

“Not for long,” said Harry, yawning. 



Page | 264 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She 
was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and 
wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry 
associated with exam review. 

“Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging 
their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to 
poke around in her beaded bag, “Polyjuice Potion ... 
Invisibility Cloak ... Decoy Detonators ... You should 
each take a couple just in case. ... Puking Pastilles, 
Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable Ears ...” 

They gulped down their breakfast, then set off 
upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and promising to 
have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when 
they returned. 

“Bless him,” said Ron fondly, “and when you think I 
used to fantasize about cutting off his head and 
sticking it on the wall.” 

They made their way onto the front step with 
immense caution: They could see a couple of puffy- 
eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across 
the misty square. 

Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came 
back for Harry. 

After the usual brief spell of darkness and near 
suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway 
where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to 
take place. It was as yet deserted, except for a couple 
of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not 
usually appear here until at least eight o’clock. 

“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch. 

“She ought to be here in about five minutes. When 
I’ve Stunned her — ” 

Page | 265 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Hermione, we know,” said Ron sternly. “And I 
thought we were supposed to open the door before 
she got here?” 

Hermione squealed. 

“I nearly forgot! Stand back — ” 

She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily 
graffitied fire door beside them, which burst open 
with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they 
knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty 
theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to 
make it look as though it was still closed. 

“And now,” she said, turning back to face the other 
two in the alleyway, “we put on the Cloak again — ” 

“ — and we wait,” Ron finished, throwing it over 
Hermione ’s head like a blanket over a birdcage and 
rolling his eyes at Harry. 

Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop 
and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair 
Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the 
sudden brightness; the sun had just come out from 
behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the 
unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione ’s 
silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she 
toppled over. 

“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from 
behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off 
the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little 
witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. 
Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s head 
and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion 
she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was 
rummaging through the little witch’s handbag. 

Page | 266 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small 
card that identified their victim as an assistant in the 
Improper Use of Magic Office. “You’d better take this, 
Hermione, and here are the tokens.” 

He passed her several small golden coins, all 
embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had 
taken from the witch’s purse. 

Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now 
a pleasant heliotrope color, and within seconds stood 
before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she 
removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, Harry 
checked his watch. 

“We’re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be 
here any second.” 

They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; 
Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over 
themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. 
Seconds later there was another pop, and a small, 
ferrety-looking wizard appeared before them. 

“Oh, hello, Mafalda.” 

“Hello!” said Hermione in a quavery voice. “How are 
you today?” 

“Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who 
looked thoroughly downcast. 

As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main 
road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them. 

“I’m sorry to hear you’re under the weather,” said 
Hermione, talking firmly over the little wizard as he 
tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential 



Page | 267 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




to stop him from reaching the street. “Here, have a 
sweet.” 

“Eh? Oh, no thanks — ” 

“I insist!” said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag 
of pastilles in his face. Looking rather alarmed, the 
little wizard took one. 

The effect was instantaneous. The moment the 
pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard started 
vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as 
Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of 
his head. 

“Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with 
sick. “Perhaps you’d better take the day off!” 

“No — no!” He choked and retched, trying to continue 
on his way despite being unable to walk straight. “I 
must — today — must go — ” 

“But that’s just silly!” said Hermione, alarmed. “You 
can’t go to work in this state — I think you ought to 
go to St. Mungo’s and get them to sort you out!” 

The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still 
trying to crawl toward the main street. 

“You simply can’t go to work like this!” cried 
Hermione. 

At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. 
Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his way back into 
a standing position, he turned on the spot and 
vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron 
had snatched from his hand as he went and some 
flying chunks of vomit. 



Page | 268 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Urgh,” said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her 
robe to avoid the puddles of sick. “It would have made 
much less mess to Stun him too.” 

“Yeah,” said Ron, emerging from under the cloak 
holding the wizard’s bag, “but I still think a whole pile 
of unconscious bodies would have drawn more 
attention. Keen on his job, though, isn’t he? Chuck us 
the hair and the potion, then.” 

Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small 
and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy 
blue robes that had been folded in his bag. 

“Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, 
seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, I’m Reg 
Cattermole, according to the label in the back.” 

“Now wait here,” Hermione told Harry, who was still 
under the Invisibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with 
some hairs for you.” 

He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much 
longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered 
alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned 
Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared. 

“We don’t know who he is,” Hermione said, passing 
Harry several curly black hairs, “but he’s gone home 
with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he’s pretty tall, you’ll 
need bigger robes. ...” 

She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had 
laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the 
potion and change. 

Once the painful transformation was complete he was 
more than six feet tall and, from what he could tell 
from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also 

Page | 269 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his 
glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other 
two. 

“Blimey, that’s scary,” said Ron, looking up at Harry, 
who now towered over him. 

“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, 
“and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.” 

They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards 
along the crowded pavement there were spiked black 
railings flanking two flights of steps, one labeled 
GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. 

“See you in a moment, then,” said Hermione 
nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to 
LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly 
dressed men descending into what appeared to be an 
ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy 
black and white. 

“Morning, Reg!” called another wizard in navy blue 
robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his 
golden token into a slot in the door. “Blooming pain in 
the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this 
way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry 
Potter?” 

The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron 
gave a forced chuckle. 

“Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?” 

And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining 
cubicles. 

To Harry’s left and right came the sound of flushing. 
He crouched down and peered through the gap at the 

Page | 270 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of 
booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He 
looked left and saw Ron blinking at him. 

“We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered. 

“Looks like it,” Harry whispered back; his voice came 
out deep and gravelly. 

They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, 
Harry clambered into the toilet. 

He knew at once that he had done the right thing; 
though he appeared to be standing in water, his 
shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached 
up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed 
down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into 
the Ministry of Magic. 

He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body 
than he was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed 
darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden 
fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting 
shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden 
floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone 
dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this 
vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on 
ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry 
workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. 
Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue 
were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. 

Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: 
Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace 
behind him. 

“Out of the way, can’t y — oh, sorry, Runcorn!” 



Page | 271 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. 
Apparently the man whom Harry was impersonating, 
Runcorn, was intimidating. 

“Psst!” said a voice, and he looked around to see a 
wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical 
Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the 
statue. Harry hastened to join them. 

“You got in all right, then?” Hermione whispered to 
Harry. 

“No, he’s still stuck in the bog,” said Ron. 

“Oh, very funny ... It’s horrible, isn’t it?” she said to 
Harry, who was staring up at the statue. “Have you 
seen what they’re sitting on? 

Harry looked more closely and realized that what he 
had thought were decoratively carved thrones were 
actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and 
hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and 
children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted 
and pressed together to support the weight of the 
handsomely robed wizards. 

“Muggles,” whispered Hermione. “In their rightful 
place. Come on, let’s get going.” 

They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving 
toward the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking 
around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was 
no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. 
They passed through the gates and into a smaller 
hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty 
golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely 
joined the nearest one when a voice said, 

“Cattermole!” 



Page | 272 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




They looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over. 
One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed 
Dumbledore’s death was striding toward them. The 
Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their eyes 
downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through 
them. The man’s scowling, slightly brutish face was 
somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping 
robes, which were embroidered with much gold 
thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called 
sycophantically, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored 
them. 

“I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to 
sort out my office, Cattermole. It’s still raining in 
there.” 

Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else 
would intervene, but nobody spoke. 

“Raining ... in your office? That’s — that’s not good, is 
it?” 



Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley’s eyes widened. 

“You think it’s funny, Cattermole, do you?” 

A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the 
lift and bustled off. 

“No,” said Ron, “no, of course — ” 

“You realize that I am on my way downstairs to 
interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I’m quite 
surprised you’re not down there holding her hand 
while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, 
have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a 
pureblood next time.” 



Page | 273 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley 
looked at her. She coughed feebly and turned away. 

“I — I — ” stammered Ron. 

“But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” 
said Yaxley, “ — not that any woman I married would 
ever be mistaken for such filth — and the Head of the 
Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job 
doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, 
Cattermole. Do you understand me?” 

“Yes,” whispered Ron. 

“Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not 
completely dry within an hour, your wife’s Blood 
Status will be in even graver doubt than it is now.” 

The golden grille before them clattered open. With a 
nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was 
evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of 
Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody 
followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The 
grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move 
upward. 

“What am I going to do?” Ron asked the other two at 
once; he looked stricken. “If I don’t turn up, my wife 
— I mean, Cattermole ’s wife — ” 

“Well come with you, we should stick together — ” 
began Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly. 

“That’s mental, we haven’t got much time. You two 
find Umbridge, I’ll go and sort out Yaxley’s office — 
but how do I stop it raining?” 



Page | 274 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Try Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione at once, “that 
should stop the rain if it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t, 
something’s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, 
which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim 
measure try Impervius to protect his belongings — ” 

“Say it again, slowly — ” said Ron, searching his 
pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment 
the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice 
said, “Level four, Department for the Regulation and 
Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, 
Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and 
Pest Advisory Bureau,” and the grilles slid open again, 
admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet 
paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the 
ceiling of the lift. 

“Morning, Albert,” said a bushily whiskered man, 
smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and 
Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; 
Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to 
Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and 
muttered, “Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? 
Nice one, Albert. I’m pretty confident I’ll get his job 
now!” 

He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would 
suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more. 

“Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, 
including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror 
Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration 
Services,” said the disembodied witch’s voice. 

Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he 
hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, 
leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the 
golden door had closed Hermione said, very fast, 
“Actually, Harry, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t 
Page | 275 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




think he knows what he’s doing and if he gets caught 
the whole thing — ” 



“Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.” 

The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione 
gasped. Four people stood before them, two of them 
deep in conversation: a longhaired wizard wearing 
magnificent robes of black and gold, and a squat, 
toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair 
and clutching a clipboard to her chest. 



Page | 276 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION 
COMMISSION 

“Ah, Mafalda!” said Umbridge, looking at Hermione. 
“Travers sent you, did he?” 

“Y-yes,” squeaked Hermione. 

“Good, youll do perfectly well.” Umbridge spoke to the 
wizard in black and gold. “That’s that problem solved, 
Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping 
we shall be able to start straightaway.” She consulted 
her clipboard. “Ten people today and one of them the 
wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut ... even here, in 
the heart of the Ministry!” She stepped into the lift 
beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had 
been listening to Umbridge’s conversation with the 
Minister. “We’ll go straight down, Mafalda, you’ll find 
everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, 
Albert, aren’t you getting out?” 

“Yes, of course,” said Harry in Runcorn’s deep voice. 



Page | 277 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Harry stepped out of the lift. The golden grilles 
clanged shut behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, 
Harry saw Hermione’s anxious face sinking back out 
of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge’s 
velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. 

“What brings you up here, Runcorn?” asked the new 
Minister of Magic. His long black hair and beard were 
streaked with silver, and a great overhanging 
forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in 
mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock. 

“Needed a quick word with,” Harry hesitated for a 
fraction of a second, “Arthur Weasley. Someone said 
he was up on level one.” 

“Ah,” said Pius Thicknesse. “Has he been caught 
having contact with an Undesirable?” 

“No,” said Harry, his throat dry. “No, nothing like 
that.” 

“Ah, well. It’s only a matter of time,” said Thicknesse. 
“If you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the 
Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.” 

“Good day, Minister.” 

Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the 
thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the Minister 
had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility 
Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak, threw it 
over himself, and set off along the corridor in the 
opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry 
was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were 
hidden. 

Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed 
gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, 

Page | 278 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




each bearing a small plaque with the owner’s name 
and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its 
complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself 
upon him so that the plan he had been carefully 
concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four 
weeks seemed laughably childish. They had 
concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without 
being detected: They had not given a moment’s 
thought to what they would do if they were forced to 
separate. Now Hermione was stuck in court 
proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; 

Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure 
was beyond him, a woman’s liberty possibly 
depending on the outcome; and he, Harry, was 
wandering around on the top floor when he knew 
perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in 
the lift. 

He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried 
to decide what to do. The silence pressed upon him: 
There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here; 
the purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as 
though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the 
place. 

Her office must be up here, Harry thought. 

It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep 
her jewelry in her office, but on the other hand it 
seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He 
therefore set off along the corridor again, passing 
nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring 
instructions to a quill that floated in front of him, 
scribbling on a trail of parchment. 

Now paying attention to the names on the doors, 

Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next 
corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a 
dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks 

Page | 279 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




not unlike school desks, though much more highly 
polished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch 
them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were 
all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and 
squares of colored paper were flying in every direction 
like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry 
realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, 
that the papers all formed the same pattern; and after 
a few more seconds he realized that what he was 
watching was the creation of pamphlets — that the 
paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, 
folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks 
beside each witch or wizard. 

Harry crept closer, although the workers were so 
intent on what they were doing that he doubted they 
would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a 
completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young 
witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. 
Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title: 

MUDBLOODS 

and the Dangers They Pose to 
a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society 

Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a 
simpering face in the middle of its petals, being 
strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. 
There was no author’s name upon the pamphlet, but 
again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed 
to tingle as he examined it. Then the young witch 
beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still 
waving and twirling her wand, “Will the old hag be 
interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?” 



Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Careful,” said the wizard beside her, glancing around 
nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the 
floor. 

“What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, 
now?” 

The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door 
facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry 
looked too, and rage reared in him like a snake. 

Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle 
front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris 
had been set into the wood — an eye that was 
shockingly familiar to anybody who had known 
Alastor Moody. 

For a split second Harry forgot where he was and 
what he was doing there: He even forgot that he was 
invisible. He strode straight over to the door to 
examine the eye. It was not moving: It gazed blindly 
upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read: 

DOLORES UMBRIDGE 

SENIOR UNDERSECRETARY TO THE MINISTER 

Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read: 

HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN 

REGISTRATION COMMISSION 

Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: 
Though they were intent upon their work, he could 
hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door 
of an empty office opened in front of them. He 
therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd 
object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed 



Page | 281 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, 
he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground. 

It scuttled away at once through the legs of the 
witches and wizards in front of him. A few moments 
later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon 
the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great 
deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. The 
young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages 
flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, 
looking around for the source of the commotion. 

Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge’s 
office, and closed the door behind him. 

He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was 
exactly like Umbridge’s office at Hogwarts: Lace 
draperies, doilies, and dried flowers covered every 
available surface. The walls bore the same 
ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, 
beribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with 
sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a 
flouncy, flowered cloth. Behind Mad-Eye’s eye, a 
telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on 
the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took 
a look through it and saw that they were all still 
gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched 
the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, 
pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in 
his pocket. Then he turned to face the room again, 
raised his wand, and murmured, “Accio Locket.” 

Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no 
doubt Umbridge knew all about protective charms 
and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and 
began pulling open the drawers. He saw quills and 
notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that 
coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be 
beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair 
bows and clips; but no sign of a locket. 

Page | 282 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set 
to searching it. Like Filch ’s filing cabinets at 
Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a 
name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost 
drawer that he saw something to distract him from 
his search: Mr. Weasley’s file. 

He pulled it out and opened it. 

ARTHUR WEASLEY 

BLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable 
pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of the Order of 
the Phoenix. 

FAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two 
youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son currently at 
home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have 
confirmed. 

SECURITY STATUS: TRACKED. All movements are 
being monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 
will contact (has stayed with Weasley family 
previously) 



“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his 
breath as he replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut 
the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, 
and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced 
around the office for fresh hiding places, he saw a 
poster of himself on the wall, with the words 
undesirable no. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A 
little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a 
kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it 
and saw that Umbridge had written, “To be punished.” 



Page | 283 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the 
bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but 
was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. 
He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his 
heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him 
from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a 
bookcase beside the desk. 

Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, 
but realized the moment he touched it that it was not 
a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out 
of the front cover of a glossy book. Harry had not 
immediately noticed the curly green writing across his 
hat — The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore — nor 
the slightly smaller writing across his chest: “by Rita 
Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master 
or Moron?” 

Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page 
photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing 
immoderately with their arms around each other’s 
shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, 
had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on 
Krum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who 
roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a 
gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in 
curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it 
was a young Doge, but before he could check the 
caption, the door of the office opened. 

If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder 
as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull 
the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he 
thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of 
movement, because for a moment or two he remained 
quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry 
had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had 
seen was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the 
front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it 
Page | 284 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk 
and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in 
the ink pot. It sprang out and began scribbling a note 
to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, 
Harry backed out of the office into the open area 
beyond. 

The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the 
remains of the Decoy Detonator, which continued to 
hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the 
corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up 
here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless, 
remember that poisonous duck?” 

Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his 
options. It had never been likely that the locket was 
here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of 
bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she 
was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had 
to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, 
and try again another day. The first thing to do was to 
find Ron, and then they could work out a way of 
extracting Hermione from the courtroom. 

The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in 
and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it started its 
descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a 
halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got 
in. 



“M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off 
again. 

“Ron, it’s me, Harry!” 

“Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like — why 
isn’t Hermione with you?” 



Page | 285 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“She had to go down to the courtrooms with 
Umbridge, she couldn’t refuse, and — ” 

But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped 
again: The doors opened and Mr. Weasley walked 
inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair 
was teased so high it resembled an anthill. 

"... I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, 
but I’m afraid I cannot be party to — ” 

Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was 
very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at him with 
that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four 
of them trundled downward once more. 

“Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at 
the sound of steady dripping from Ron’s robes. “Isn’t 
your wife in for questioning today? Er — what’s 
happened to you? Why are you so wet?” 

“Yaxley’s office is raining,” said Ron. He addressed 
Mr. Weasley’s shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was 
scared that his father might recognize him if they 
looked directly into each other’s eyes. “I couldn’t stop 
it, so they’ve sent me to get Bernie — Pillsworth, I 
think they said — ” 

“Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. 
Weasley. “Did you try Meteolojinx Recanto? It worked 
for Bletchley.” 

“Meteolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t. 
Thanks, D — I mean, thanks, Arthur.” 

The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill 
hair left, and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry 
made to follow him, but found his path blocked as 



Page | 286 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in 
some papers he was reading. 



Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy 
realize he was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, 
saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift 
the moment the doors opened again. For the second 
time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his 
way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm. 

“One moment, Runcorn.” 

The lift doors closed and as they clanked down 
another floor, Mr. Weasley said, “I hear you laid 
information about Dirk Cresswell.” 

Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger 
was no less because of the brush with Percy. He 
decided his best chance was to act stupid. 

“Sorry?” he said. 

“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely. 
“You tracked down the wizard who faked his family 
tree, didn’t you?” 

“I — so what if I did?” said Harry. 

“So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” 
said Mr. Weasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower. 
“And if he survives Azkaban, you 11 have to answer to 
him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends 



“Arthur,” Harry interrupted, “you know you’re being 
tracked, don’t you?” 

“Is that a threat, Runcorn?” said Mr. Weasley loudly. 



Page | 287 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry, “it’s a fact! They’re watching your 
every move — ” 

The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. 
Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept 
from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he 
was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn. ... 
The lift doors clanged shut. 

Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back 
on. He would try to extricate Hermione on his own 
while Ron was dealing with the raining office. When 
the doors opened, he stepped out into a torch-lit 
stone passageway quite different from the wood- 
paneled and carpeted corridors above. As the lift 
rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking 
toward the distant black door that marked the 
entrance to the Department of Mysteries. 

He set off, his destination not the black door, but the 
doorway he remembered on the left-hand side, which 
opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court 
chambers. His mind grappled with possibilities as he 
crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy 
Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply 
knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and 
ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did 
not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important 
to get away with this, and even if he managed it, 
Hermione ’s non-reappearance might trigger a search 
before they were clear of the Ministry. . . . 

Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the 
unnatural chill that was creeping over him, as if he 
were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and 
colder with every step he took: a cold that reached 
right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. And 
then he felt that stealing sense of despair, of 
hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him. ... 
Page | 288 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Dementors, he thought. 



And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to 
his right he saw a dreadful scene. The dark passage 
outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black- 
hooded figures, their faces completely hidden, their 
ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The 
petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat 
huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most 
of them were hiding their faces in their hands, 
perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves 
from the dementors’ greedy mouths. Some were 
accompanied by families, others sat alone. The 
dementors were gliding up and down in front of them, 
and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair 
of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse. 



Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could 
not conjure a Patronus here without revealing himself 
instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he 
could, and with every step he took numbness seemed 
to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think 
of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him. 

Moving through the towering black figures was 
terrifying: The eyeless faces hidden beneath their 
hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they 
sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that 
still had some hope, some resilience. ... 

And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen 
silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left of the 
corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. 

“No, no, I’m half-blood, I’m half-blood, I tell you! My 
father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie 
Alderton, he’s a well-known broomstick designer, look

him up, I tell you — get your hands off me, get your 
hands off—” 



“This is your final warning,” said Umbridge’s soft 
voice, magically magnified so that it sounded clearly 
over the man’s desperate screams. “If you struggle, 
you will be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss.” 

The man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed 
through the corridor. 

“Take him away,” said Umbridge. 

Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the 
courtroom, their rotting, scabbed hands clutching the 
upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. 
They glided away down the corridor with him, and the 
darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him 
from sight. 

“Next — Mary Cattermole,” called Umbridge. 

A small woman stood up; she was trembling from 
head to foot. Her dark hair was smoothed back into a 
bun and she wore long, plain robes. Her face was 
completely bloodless. As she passed the dementors, 
Harry saw her shudder. 

He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, 
because he hated the sight of her walking alone into 
the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he 
slipped into the courtroom behind her. 

It was not the same room in which he had once been 
interrogated for improper use of magic. This one was 
much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it 
gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the 
bottom of a deep well. 

Page | 290 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There were more dementors in here, casting their 
freezing aura over the place; they stood like faceless 
sentinels in the corners farthest from the high, raised 
platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, 
with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite 
as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At 
the foot of the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired 
cat prowled up and down, up and down, and Harry 
realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors 
from the despair that emanated from the dementors: 
That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers. 

“Sit down,” said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. 

Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the 
middle of the floor beneath the raised platform. The 
moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the 
arms of the chair and bound her there. 

“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked 
Umbridge. 

Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. 

“Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical 
Maintenance Department?” 

Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. 

“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet 
me here!” 

Umbridge ignored her. 

“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?” 

Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. 



Page | 291 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“They’re frightened, they think I might not come home 



“Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do 
not stir our sympathies.” 

Mrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as 
he made his way carefully toward the steps that led 
up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed 
the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, he felt the 
change in temperature: It was warm and comfortable 
here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge’s, 
and it glowed brightly because she was so happy 
here, in her element, upholding the twisted laws she 
had helped to write. Slowly and very carefully he 
edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, 
Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. 
He was worried about making Hermione jump. He 
thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon 
Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word 
might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge raised 
her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry 
seized his chance. 

“I’m behind you,” he whispered into Hermione’s ear. 

As he had expected, she jumped so violently she 
nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she 
was supposed to be recording the interview, but both 
Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. 
Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. 

“A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the 
Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,” Umbridge was 
saying. “Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, 
unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that description?” 

Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her 
sleeve. 

Page | 292 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard 
you took that wand?” 



“T-took?” sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. “I didn’t t-take it 
from anybody. I b-bought it when I was eleven years 
old. It — it — it — chose me.” 

She cried harder than ever. 

Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made 
Harry want to attack her. She leaned forward over the 
barrier, the better to observe her victim, and 
something gold swung forward too, and dangled over 
the void: the locket. 

Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but 
Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, 
were deaf to everything else. 

“No,” said Umbridge, “no, I don’t think so, Mrs. 
Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or wizards. 
You are not a witch. I have your responses to the 
questionnaire that was sent to you here — Mafalda, 
pass them to me.” 

Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so 
toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite 
surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. 
Hermione ’s hands were shaking with shock. She 
fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair 
beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment 
with Mrs. Cattermole’s name on it. 

“That’s — that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at 
the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of 
Umbridge’s blouse. 

“What?” snapped Umbridge, glancing down. “Oh yes 
— an old family heirloom,” she said, patting the locket 

Page | 293 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




lying on her large bosom. “The S stands for Selwyn. ... 
I am related to the Selwyns. ... Indeed, there are few 
pure-blood families to whom I am not related. ... A 
pity,” she continued in a louder voice, flicking 
through Mrs. Cattermole’s questionnaire, “that the 
same cannot be said for you. ‘Parents’ professions: 
greengrocers.’ ” 

Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat 
patrolled up and down, and the dementors stood 
waiting in the corners. 

It was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging 
into Harry’s brain and obliterated his sense of caution 
— that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a 
petty criminal was being used to bolster her own 
pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even 
troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility 
Cloak, and said, “Stupefyl” 

There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled 
and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. 
Cattermole’s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, 
down below, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold 
air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, confused, 
looked around for the source of the trouble and saw 
Harry’s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. 
He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: 

“Stupefyl” 

Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. 
“Harry!” 

“Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let 
her pretend — ” 

“Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!” 



Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility 
Cloak; down below, the dementors had moved out of 
their corners; they were gliding toward the woman 
chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus 
had vanished or because they sensed that their 
masters were no longer in control, they seemed to 
have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a 
terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand 
grasped her chin and forced her face back. 

“EXPECTO PATRONUM” 

The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry’s wand 
and leaped toward the dementors, which fell back and 
melted into the dark shadows again. The stag’s light, 
more powerful and more warming than the cat’s 
protection, filled the whole dungeon as it cantered 
around and around the room. 

“Get the Horcrux,” Harry told Hermione. 

He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility 
Cloak back into his bag, and approached Mrs. 
Cattermole. 

“You?” she whispered, gazing into his face. “But — 
but Reg said you were the one who submitted my 
name for questioning!” 

“Did I?” muttered Harry, tugging at the chains 
binding her arms. “Well, I’ve had a change of heart. 
Diffindol” Nothing happened. “Hermione, how do I get 
rid of these chains?” 

“Wait, I’m trying something up here — ” 

“Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors!” 



Page | 295 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the 
locket’s gone — I need to duplicate it — Geminio\ 
There ... That should fool her. ...” 



Hermione came running downstairs. 

“Let’s see. ... Relashiol” 

The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the 
chair. Mrs. Cattermole looked just as frightened as 
ever before. 

“I don’t understand,” she whispered. 

“You’re going to leave here with us,” said Harry, 
pulling her to her feet. “Go home, grab your children, 
and get out, get out of the country if you’ve got to. 
Disguise yourselves and run. You’ve seen how it is, 
you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.” 

“Harry,” said Hermione, “how are we going to get out 
of here with all those dementors outside the door?” 

“Patronuses,” said Harry, pointing his wand at his 
own: The stag slowed and walked, still gleaming 
brightly, toward the door. “As many as we can 
muster; do yours, Hermione.” 

“Expec — Expecto patronum,” said Hermione. Nothing 
happened. 

“It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” Harry 
told a completely bemused Mrs. Cattermole. “Bit 
unfortunate, really ... Come on, Hermione. ...” 

“Expecto patronum).” 

A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione ’s wand 
and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag. 

Page | 296 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“C’mon,” said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. 
Cattermole to the door. 

When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there 
were cries of shock from the people waiting outside. 
Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back 
on both sides of them, melding into the darkness, 
scattering before the silver creatures. 

“It’s been decided that you should all go home and go 
into hiding with your families,” Harry told the waiting 
Muggle-borns, who were dazzled by the light of the 
Patronuses and still cowering slightly. “Go abroad if 
you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That’s 
the — er — new official position. Now, if you’ll just 
follow the Patronuses, you’ll be able to leave from the 
Atrium.” 

They managed to get up the stone steps without being 
intercepted, but as they approached the lifts Harry 
started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the 
Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside 
it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused 
Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they 
would attract unwanted attention. He had just 
reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift 
clanged to a halt in front of them. 

“Reg!” screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw 
herself into Ron’s arms. “Runcorn let me out, he 
attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us 
to leave the country, I think we’d better do it, Reg, I 
really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children and 
— why are you so wet?” 

“Water,” muttered Ron, disengaging himself. “Harry, 
they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, 
something about a hole in Umbridge’s office door, I 
reckon we’ve got five minutes if that — ” 

Page | 297 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione ’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she 
turned a horror-struck face to Harry. 

“Harry, if we’re trapped here — !” 

“We won’t be if we move fast,” said Harry. He 
addressed the silent group behind them, who were all 
gawping at him. 

“Who’s got wands?” 

About half of them raised their hands. 

“Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to 
attach yourself to somebody who has. We’ll need to be 
fast before they stop us. Come on.” 

They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. 
Harry’s Patronus stood sentinel before the golden 
grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. 

“Level eight,” said the witch’s cool voice, “Atrium.” 

Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The 
Atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to 
fireplace, sealing them off. 

“Harry!” squeaked Hermione. “What are we going to — 
?” 

“STOP!” Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of 
Runcorn echoed through the Atrium: The wizards 
sealing the fireplaces froze. “Follow me,” he whispered 
to the group of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved 
forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and 
Hermione. 



Page | 298 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s up, Albert?” said the same balding wizard 
who had followed Harry out of the fireplace earlier. He 
looked nervous. 



“This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said 
Harry with all the authority he could muster. 

The group of wizards in front of him looked at one 
another. 

“We’ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone — 



“ Are you contradicting me?” Harry blustered. “Would 
you like me to have your family tree examined, like I 
had Dirk Cresswell’s?” 

“Sorry!” gasped the balding wizard, backing away. “I 
didn’t mean nothing, Albert, but I thought ... I 
thought they were in for questioning and ...” 

“Their blood is pure,” said Harry, and his deep voice 
echoed impressively through the hall. “Purer than 
many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,” he boomed to 
the Muggle-borns, who scurried forward into the 
fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry 
wizards hung back, some looking confused, others 
scared and resentful. Then: 

“Mary!” 

Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real 
Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but pale and wan, 
had just come running out of a lift. 

“R-Reg?” 

She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore 
loudly. 

Page | 299 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The balding wizard gaped, his head turning 
ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other. 



“Hey — what’s going on? What is this?” 

“Seal the exit! SEAL IT!” 

Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running 
toward the group beside the fireplaces, into which all 
of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now 
vanished. As the balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry 
raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending 
him flying through the air. 

“He’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” 
Harry shouted. 

The balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, 
under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, 
pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and 
disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to 
the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole 
screamed, “My wife! Who was that with my wife? 
What’s going on?” 

Harry saw Yaxley’s head turn, saw an inkling of the 
truth dawn in that brutish face. 

“Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her 
hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as 
Yaxley’s curse sailed over Harry’s head. They spun for 
a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a 
cubicle. Harry flung open the door; Ron was standing 
there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. 
Cattermole. 

“Reg, I don’t understand — ” 

“Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!” 

Page | 300 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry 
looked around; Yaxley had just appeared. 

“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the 
hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot. 

Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of 
compressing bands, but something was wrong. ... 
Hermione ’s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. 



He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he 
could not breathe or see and the only solid things in 
the world were Ron’s arm and Hermione ’s fingers, 
which were slowly slipping away. . . . 

And then he saw the door of number twelve, 
Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, but 
before he could draw breath, there was a scream and 
a flash of purple light; Hermione ’s hand was suddenly 
vicelike upon his and everything went dark again. 



Page | 301 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE THIEF 

Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and 
green; he had no idea what had happened, he only 
knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves 
and twigs. Struggling to draw breath into lungs that 
felt flattened, he blinked and realized that the gaudy 
glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of 
leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to 
his face. He pushed himself onto his hands and 
knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but 
saw that the object was Ron’s foot. Looking around, 
Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a 
forest floor, apparently alone. 

Harry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and 
for a moment, even though he knew how foolish and 
dangerous it would be for them to appear in the 
grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of 
sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut. However, 
in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan 
and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized 
that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees 



Page | 302 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the 
ground clearer. 



He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at 
Ron’s head. The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all 
other concerns fled Harry’s mind, for blood drenched 
the whole of Ron’s left side and his face stood out, 
grayish- white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The 
Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was 
halfway between Cattermole and himself in 
appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his 
face drained of the little color it had left. 

“What’s happened to him?” 

“Splinched,” said Hermione, her fingers already busy 
at Ron’s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and 
darkest. 

Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron’s 
shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as 
something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled 
unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron’s upper arm, 
where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped 
cleanly away as though by a knife. 

“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle 
labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’ — ” 

“Bag — right — ” 

Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, 
seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand 
inside it. At once, object after object began presenting 
itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines of books, 
woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes — 

“Quickly\” 

Page | 303 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it 
into the depths of the magical bag. 

“Accio Dittany\” 

A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he 
caught it and hastened back to Hermione and Ron, 
whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white 
eyeball all that were visible between his lids. 

“He’s fainted,” said Hermione, who was also rather 
pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, though her 
hair was still gray in places. “Unstopper it for me, 
Harry, my hands are shaking.” 

Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, 
Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion 
onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed 
upward and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the 
bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several 
days old; new skin stretched over what had just been 
open flesh. 

“Wow,” said Harry. 

“It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. 
“There are spells that would put him completely right, 
but I daren’t try in case I do them wrong and cause 
more damage. ... He’s lost so much blood already. ...” 

“How did he get hurt? I mean” — Harry shook his 
head, trying to clear it, to make sense of whatever had 
just taken place — “why are we here? I thought we 
were going back to Grimmauld Place?” 

Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to 
tears. 



Page | 304 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to go back 
there.” 

“What d’you — ?” 

“As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I 
couldn’t get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was 
still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, 
and then — well, I think he must have seen the door, 
and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened 
his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought 
us here instead!” 

“But then, where’s he? Hang on. ... You don’t mean 
he’s at Grimmauld Place? He can’t get in there?” 

Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. 

“Harry, I think he can. I — I forced him to let go with 
a Revulsion Jinx, but I’d already taken him inside the 
Fidelius Charm’s protection. Since Dumbledore died, 
we’re Secret-Keepers, so I’ve given him the secret, 
haven’t I?” 

There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was 
right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get 
inside the house, there was no way that they could 
return. Even now, he could be bringing other Death 
Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive 
though the house was, it had been their one safe 
refuge: even, now that Kreacher was so much happier 
and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret 
that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the 
house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney 
pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat. 

“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” 



Page | 305 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! If anything, it 
was mine. ...” 

Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad- 
Eye’s eye. Hermione recoiled, looking horrified. 

“Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on 
people. I couldn’t leave it there ... but that’s how they 
knew there were intruders.” 

Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and 
opened his eyes. He was still gray and his face 
glistened with sweat. 

“How d’you feel?” Hermione whispered. 

“Lousy,” croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured 
arm. “Where are we?” 

“In the woods where they held the Quidditch World 
Cup,” said Hermione. “I wanted somewhere enclosed, 
undercover, and this was — ” 

“ — the first place you thought of,” Harry finished for 
her, glancing around at the apparently deserted 
glade. He could not help remembering what had 
happened the last time they had Apparated to the 
first place Hermione had thought of — how Death 
Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been 
Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, 
even now, where Hermione had taken them? 

“D’you reckon we should move on?” Ron asked Harry, 
and Harry could tell by the look on Ron’s face that he 
was thinking the same. 

“I dunno.” 



Page | 306 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no 
attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too 
weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was 
daunting. 

“Let’s stay here for now,” Harry said. 

Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. 

“Where are you going?” asked Ron. 

“If we’re staying, we should put some protective 
enchantments around the place,” she replied, and 
raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle 
around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as 
she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the 
surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a 
heat haze upon their clearing. 

“Salvio Hexia ... Protego Totalum ... Repello Muggletum 
... Muffliato ... You could get out the tent, Harry. ...” 

“Tent?” 

“In the bag!” 

“In the ... of course,” said Harry. 

He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but 
used another Summoning Charm. The tent emerged 
in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope, and poles. Harry 
recognized it, partly because of the smell of cats, as 
the same tent in which they had slept on the night of 
the Quidditch World Cup. 

“I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the 
Ministry?” he asked, starting to disentangle the tent 
pegs. 



Page | 307 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so 
bad,” said Hermione, now performing complicated 
figure-of-eight movements with her wand, “so Ron’s 
dad said I could borrow it. ErectoV’ she added, 
pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in 
one fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully 
constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of 
whose startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with 
a final thud at the end of a guy rope. 

“ Cave Inimicum,” Hermione finished with a skyward 
flourish. “That’s as much as I can do. At the very 
least, we should know they’re coming, I can’t 
guarantee it will keep out Vol — ” 

“Don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice 
harsh. 

Harry and Hermione looked at each other. 

“I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised 
himself to look at them, “but it feels like a — a jinx or 
something. Can’t we call him You-Know-Who — 
please?” 

“Dumbledore said fear of a name — ” began Harry. 

“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know- 
Who by his name didn’t do Dumbledore much good in 
the end,” Ron snapped back. “Just — just show You- 
Know-Who some respect, will you?” 

“Respect?” Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a 
warning look; apparently he was not to argue with 
Ron while the latter was in such a weakened 
condition. 

Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron 
through the entrance of the tent. The interior was 

Page | 308 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




exactly as Harry remembered it: a small flat, complete 
with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an 
old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower 
berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had 
turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him 
on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not 
speak for a while. 

“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, 
pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag 
and heading toward the kitchen. 

Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the 
firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had 
died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear 
fluttering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron 
broke the silence. 

“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?” 

“With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, 
clutching her hot mug for comfort. “As long as Mr. 
Cattermole had his wits about him, he’ll have 
transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along- Apparition 
and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with their 
children. That’s what Harry told her to do.” 

“Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back 
on his pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; 
a little of his color had returned. “I didn’t get the 
feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, 
though, the way everyone was talking to me when I 
was him. God, I hope they made it. ... If they both end 
up in Azkaban because of us ...” 

Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he 
had been about to ask — about whether Mrs. 
Cattermole ’s lack of a wand would prevent her 
Apparating alongside her husband — died in his 

Page | 309 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate 
of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in 
her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had 
surprised her in the act of kissing him. 

“So, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to 
remind her that he was there. 

“Got — got what?” she said with a little start. 

“What did we just go through all that for? The locket! 
Where’s the locket?” 

“ You got it?” shouted Ron, raising himself a little 
higher on his pillows. “No one tells me anything! 
Blimey, you could have mentioned it!” 

“Well, we were running for our lives from the Death 
Eaters, weren’t we?” said Hermione. “Here.” 

And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her 
robes and handed it to Ron. 

It was as large as a chicken’s egg. An ornate letter S, 
inlaid with many small green stones, glinted dully in 
the diffused light shining through the tent’s canvas 
roof. 

“There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since 
Kreacher had it?” asked Ron hopefully. “I mean, are 
we sure it’s still a Horcrux?” 

“I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him 
and looking at it closely. “There ’d be some sign of 
damage if it had been magically destroyed.” 

She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his 
fingers. The thing looked perfect, pristine. He 
remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and 

Page | 310 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been cracked 
open when Dumbledore destroyed it. 



“I reckon Kreacher’s right,” said Harry. “We’re going to 
have to work out how to open this thing before we can 
destroy it.” 

Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what 
lived behind the little golden doors, hit Harry as he 
spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a 
violent urge to fling the locket from him. Mastering 
himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with 
his fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had 
used to open Regulus’s bedroom door. Neither 
worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and 
Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no 
more successful at opening it than he had been. 

“Can you feel it, though?” Ron asked in a hushed 
voice, as he held it tight in his clenched fist. 

“What d’you mean?” 

Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or 
two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it 
his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could 
feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like 
a tiny metal heart? 

“What are we going to do with it?” Hermione asked. 

“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” Harry 
replied, and, little though he wanted to, he hung the 
chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out 
of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his 
chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him. 

“I think we should take it in turns to keep watch 
outside the tent,” he added to Hermione, standing up 

Page | 311 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and stretching. “And we’ll need to think about some 
food as well. You stay there,” he added sharply, as 
Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of 
green. 

With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for 
his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, 
Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing 
the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope 
remained silent and still upon its point all day, and 
whether because of the protective enchantments and 
Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread 
around them, or because people rarely ventured this 
way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart 
from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought 
no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places 
with Hermione at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a 
deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above 
him across the single patch of starry sky visible from 
their protected clearing. 

He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. 

Hermione had not packed any food in her magical 
bag, as she had assumed that they would be 
returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had 
had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that 
Hermione had collected from amongst the nearest 
trees and stewed in a billycan. After a couple of 
mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking 
queasy; Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt 
Hermione ’s feelings. 

The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings 
and what sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry 
thought that they were caused by animals rather than 
people, yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. 
His insides, already uncomfortable due to their 
inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled 
with unease. 

Page | 312 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He had thought that he would feel elated if they 
managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he 
did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the 
darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was 
worry about what would happen next. It was as 
though he had been hurtling toward this point for 
weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had 
come to an abrupt halt, run out of road. 

There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but 
he did not have the faintest idea where they could be. 
He did not even know what all of them were. 
Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy 
the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that 
currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. 
Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but 
lay so cold against his skin it might just have 
emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry 
thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the 
tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own. 

Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there 
in the dark: He tried to resist them, push them away, 
yet they came at him relentlessly. Neither can live 
while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now 
talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away 
if they wanted to: He could not. And it seemed to 
Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear 
and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest 
was ticking away the time he had left. ... Stupid idea, 
he told himself, don’t think that. ... 

His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid 
that he was making it happen by having these 
thoughts, and tried to direct them into another 
channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had 
expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. 
Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death 
Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe 
Page | 313 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




that Kreacher had changed toward him in the past 
month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew 
what would happen? What if the Death Eaters 
tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry’s 
head and he tried to push these away too, for there 
was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and 
Hermione had already decided against trying to 
summon him; what if someone from the Ministry 
came too? They could not count on elfish Apparition 
being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley 
to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione ’s sleeve. 

Harry’s scar was burning now. He thought that there 
was so much they did not know: Lupin had been right 
about magic they had never encountered or imagined. 
Why hadn’t Dumbledore explained more? Had he 
thought that there would be time; that he would live 
for years, for centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas 
Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. ... Snape had seen 
to that. ... Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck 
at the top of the tower . . . 

And Dumbledore had fallen ... fallen ... 

“ Give it to me, Gregorovitch.” 

Harry’s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held 
in front of him by a long-fingered white hand. The 
man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside 
down in midair, though there were no ropes holding 
him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his 
limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level 
with Harry’s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed 
to his head. He had pure-white hair and a thick, 
bushy beard: a trussed-up Father Christmas. 

“I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years 
ago, stolen from me!” 



Page | 314 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He 
knows. ... He always knows.” 

The hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with 
fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until 
their blackness swallowed Harry whole — 

And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in 
stout little Gregorovitch ’s wake as he held a lantern 
aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of 
the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked 
like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in 
the swinging pool of light, and there on the window 
ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with 
golden hair. In the split second that the lantern’s light 
illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his 
handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning 
Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out 
of the window with a crow of laughter. 

And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, 
tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch ’s face was stricken 
with terror. 

“Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?” said the high cold 
voice. 

“I do not know, I never knew, a young man — no — 
please — PLEASE !” 

A scream that went on and on and then a burst of 
green light — 

“ Harryl ” 

He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. 
He had passed out against the side of the tent, had 
slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on 
the ground. He looked up at Hermione, whose bushy 

Page | 315 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through 
the dark branches high above them. 

“Dream,” he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to 
meet Hermione ’s glower with a look of innocence. 
“Must’ve dozed off, sorry.” 

“I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your 
face! You were looking into Vol — ” 

“Don’t say his name!” came Ron’s angry voice from 
the depths of the tent. 

“Fine,” retorted Hermione. “You-Know-Who’s mind, 
then!” 

“I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said. “It was a 
dream! Can you control what you dream about, 
Hermione?” 

“If you just learned to apply Occlumency — ” 

But Harry was not interested in being told off; he 
wanted to discuss what he had just seen. 

“He’s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he’s 
killed him, but before he killed him he read 
Gregorovitch ’s mind and I saw — ” 

“I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired 
you’re falling asleep,” said Hermione coldly. 

“I can finish the watch!” 

“No, you’re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.” 

She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking 
stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry 
ducked back inside. 

Page | 316 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower 
bunk; Harry climbed into the one above him, lay 
down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After 
several moments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it 
would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the 
entrance. 

“What’s You-Know-Who doing?” 

Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember 
every detail, then whispered into the darkness. 

“He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was 
torturing him.” 

“How’s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new 
wand if he’s tied up?” 

“I dunno. ... It’s weird, isn’t it?” 

Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all he had seen and 
heard. The more he recalled, the less sense it made. 

... Voldemort had said nothing about Harry’s wand, 
nothing about the twin cores, nothing about 
Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand 
to beat Harry’s. ... 

“He wanted something from Gregorovitch,” Harry 
said, eyes still closed tight. “He asked him to hand it 
over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from 
him ... and then ... then ...” 

He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to 
hurtle through Gregorovitch ’s eyes, into his 
memories. ... 

“He read Gregorovitch ’s mind, and I saw this young 
bloke perched on a windowsill, and he fired a curse at 
Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he 

Page | 317 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




stole whatever You-Know-Who’s after. And I ... I think 
I’ve seen him somewhere. ...” 

Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the 
laughing boy’s face. The theft had happened many 
years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the 
young thief look familiar? 

The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled 
inside the tent; all Harry could hear was Ron’s 
breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, “Couldn’t 
you see what the thief was holding?” 

“No ... it must’ve been something small.” 

“Harry?” 

The wooden slats of Ron’s bunk creaked as he 
repositioned himself in bed. 

“Harry, you don’t reckon You-Know-Who’s after 
something else to turn into a Horcrux?” 

“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly. “Maybe. But 
wouldn’t it be dangerous for him to make another 
one? Didn’t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to 
the limit already?” 

“Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.” 

“Yeah ... maybe,” said Harry. 

He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking 
for a way around the problem of the twin cores, sure 
that Voldemort sought a solution from the old 
wandmaker . . . and yet he had killed him, apparently 
without asking him a single question about wandlore. 



Page | 318 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the 
Ministry of Magic and the Wizarding world at his feet, 
was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object 
that Gregorovitch had once owned, and which had 
been stolen by the unknown thief? 

Harry could still see the blond-haired youth’s face; it 
was merry, wild; there was a Fred and George-ish air 
of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from 
the windowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him 
before, but he could not think where. ... 

With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief 
who was in danger now, and it was on him that 
Harry’s thoughts dwelled, as Ron’s snores began to 
rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted 
slowly into sleep once more.

THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE 

Early next morning, before the other two were awake, 
Harry left the tent to search the woods around them 
for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree 
he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye 
Moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small 
cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but 
Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred 
this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge’s door. Then 
he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, 
and discuss what they were going to do next. 

Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay 
anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole 
proviso that their next move took them within reach 
of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the 
enchantments she had placed around the clearing, 
while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and 
impressions on the ground that might show they had 
camped there. Then they Disapparated to the 
outskirts of a small market town. 



Page | 320 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a 
small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly 
cast defensive enchantments, Harry ventured out 
under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, 
however, did not go as planned. He had barely 
entered the town when an unnatural chill, a 
descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies 
made him freeze where he stood. 

“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested 
Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty- 
handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, 
dementors. 

“I couldn’t ... make one,” he panted, clutching the 
stitch in his side. “Wouldn’t ... come.” 

Their expressions of consternation and 
disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had 
been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors 
gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, 
as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant 
screaming filled his ears, that he was not going to be 
able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry’s 
willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, 
leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the 
Muggles who might not be able to see them, but 
would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever 
they went. 

“So we still haven’t got any food.” 

“Shut up, Ron,” snapped Hermione. “Harry, what 
happened? Why do you think you couldn’t make your 
Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!” 

“I don’t know.” 



Page | 321 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling 
more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that 
something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday 
seemed a long time ago: Today he might have been 
thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed 
on the Hogwarts Express. 

Ron kicked a chair leg. 

“What?” he snarled at Hermione. “I’m starving! All I’ve 
had since I bled half to death is a couple of 
toadstools!” 

“You go and fight your way through the dementors, 
then,” said Harry, stung. 

“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t 
noticed!” 

“That’s convenient.” 

“And what’s that supposed to — ?” 

“Of course!” cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her 
forehead and startling both of them into silence. 
“Harry, give me the locket! Come on,” she said 
impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did 
not react, “the Horcrux, Harry, you’re still wearing it!” 

She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden 
chain over his head. The moment it parted contact 
with Harry’s skin he felt free and oddly light. He had 
not even realized that he was clammy or that there 
was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until 
both sensations lifted. 

“Better?” asked Hermione. 

“Yeah, loads better!” 

Page | 322 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry,” she said, crouching down in front of him and 
using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the 
very sick, “you don’t think you’ve been possessed, do 
you?” 

“What? No!” he said defensively. “I remember 
everything we’ve done while I’ve been wearing it. I 
wouldn’t know what I’d done if I’d been possessed, 
would I? Ginny told me there were times when she 
couldn’t remember anything.” 

“Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy 
gold locket. “Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We 
can just keep it in the tent.” 

“We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,” Harry 
stated firmly. “If we lose it, if it gets stolen — ” 

“Oh, all right, all right,” said Hermione, and she 
placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of 
sight down the front of her shirt. “But we’ll take turns 
wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.” 

“Great,” said Ron irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that 
out, can we please get some food?” 

“Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said 
Hermione with half a glance at Harry. “There’s no 
point staying where we know dementors are swooping 
around.” 

In the end they settled down for the night in a far- 
flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they 
had managed to obtain eggs and bread. 

“It’s not stealing, is it?” asked Hermione in a troubled 
voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. “Not 
if I left some money under the chicken coop?” 



Page | 323 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, 

“ ’Er-my-nee, ’oo worry ’oo much. ’Elax!” 

And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they 
were comfortably well fed: The argument about the 
dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and 
Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first 
of the three night watches. 

This was their first encounter with the fact that a full 
stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering 
and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, 
because he had suffered periods of near starvation at 
the Dursleys’. Hermione bore up reasonably well on 
those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing 
but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a 
little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. 
Ron, however, had always been used to three 
delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the 
Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both 
unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food 
coincided with Ron’s turn to wear the Horcrux, he 
became downright unpleasant. 

“So where next?” was his constant refrain. He did not 
seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry 
and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and 
brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry 
and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide 
where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how 
to destroy the one they had already got, their 
conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as 
they had no new information. 

As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed 
Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places 
important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of 
dreary litany, those locations they knew that 
Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where 
Page | 324 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, where he had 
been educated; Borgin and Burkes, where he had 
worked after completing school; then Albania, where 
he had spent his years of exile: These formed the 
basis of their speculations. 

“Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than 
an afternoon to search an entire country,” said Ron 
sarcastically. 

“There can’t be anything there. He’d already made five 
of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and 
Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,” said 
Hermione. “We know the snake’s not in Albania, it’s 
usually with Vol — ” 

“Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?” 

“Fine! The snake is usually with You-Knotu-Who — 
happy?” 

“Not particularly.” 

“I can’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and 
Burkes,” said Harry, who had made this point many 
times before, but said it again simply to break the 
nasty silence. “Borgin and Burke were experts at 
Dark objects, they would’ve recognized a Horcrux 
straightaway.” 

Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to 
throw something at him, Harry plowed on, “I still 
reckon he might have hidden something at 
Hogwarts.” 

Hermione sighed. 

“But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!” 



Page | 325 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in 
favor of this theory. 

“Dumbledore said in front of me that he never 
assumed he knew all of Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling 
you, if there was one place Vol — ” 

“Oi!” 



“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded 
past endurance. “If there was one place that was 
really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!” 

“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His school?” 

“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place 
that meant he was special; it meant everything to 
him, and even after he left — ” 

“This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? 

Not you?” inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain 
of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was visited by 
a desire to seize it and throttle him. 

“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore 
to give him a job after he left,” said Hermione. 

“That’s right,” said Harry. 

“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come 
back to try and find something, probably another 
founder’s object, to make into another Horcrux?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So 
he never got the chance to find a founder’s object 
there and hide it in the school!” 



Page | 326 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.” 

Without any other leads, they traveled into London 
and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched 
for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been 
raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered 
from their records that the place had been 
demolished many years before. They visited its site 
and found a tower block of offices. 

“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione 
suggested halfheartedly. 

“He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry 
said. He had known it all along: The orphanage had 
been the place Voldemort had been determined to 
escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul 
there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort 
sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; 
this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed 
as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry 
or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with 
its golden doors and marble floors. 

Even without any new ideas, they continued to move 
through the countryside, pitching the tent in a 
different place each night for security. Every morning 
they made sure that they had removed all clues to 
their presence, then set off to find another lonely and 
secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, 
to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, 
gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered 
and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they 
passed the Horcrux between them as though they 
were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of 
pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded the music 
stopping because the reward was twelve hours of 
increased fear and anxiety. 



Page | 327 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, 
he noticed, when he was wearing the Horcrux. 
Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the 
pain. 

“What? What did you see?” demanded Ron, whenever 
he noticed Harry wince. 

“A face,” muttered Harry, every time. “The same face. 
The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.” 

And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide 
his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping 
to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of 
the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a 
television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort 
was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took 
his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling 
endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, 
whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, 
Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry’s 
scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired 
boy swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to 
suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other 
two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of 
the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when 
they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes. 

As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to 
suspect that Ron and Hermione were having 
conversations without, and about, him. Several times 
they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the 
tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, 
huddled a little distance away, heads together and 
talking fast; both times they fell silent when they 
realized he was approaching them and hastened to 
appear busy collecting wood or water.

Harry could not help wondering whether they had 
only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless 
and rambling journey because they thought he had 
some secret plan that they would learn in due course. 
Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and 
Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was 
disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation 
he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the 
only one that continued to occur to him was 
Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at 
all likely, he stopped suggesting it. 

Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved 
through it: They were now pitching the tent on 
mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those 
cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their 
troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at 
identifying edible fungi could not altogether 
compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of 
other people’s company, or their total ignorance of 
what was going on in the war against Voldemort. 

“My mother,” said Ron one night, as they sat in the 
tent on a riverbank in Wales, “can make good food 
appear out of thin air.” 

He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish 
on his plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron’s 
neck and saw, as he had expected, the golden chain 
of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight 
down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude 
would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came 
to take off the locket. 

“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said 
Hermione. “No one can. Food is the first of the five 
Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental 
Transfigur — ” 



Page | 329 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, speak English, can’t you?” Ron said, prising a 
fish bone out from between his teeth. 

“It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You 
can Summon it if you know where it is, you can 
transform it, you can increase the quantity if you’ve 
already got some — ” 

“Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” 
said Ron. 

“Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I 
notice I’m always the one who ends up sorting out the 
food, because I’m a girl, I suppose!” 

“No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at 
magic!” shot back Ron. 

Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off 
her tin plate onto the floor. 

“ You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find 
the ingredients and try and charm them into 
something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull 
faces and moan and you can see how you — ” 

“Shut up!” said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding 
up both hands. “Shut up now\” 

Hermione looked outraged. 

“How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the 
cook — ” 

“Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!” 

He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning 
them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the 



Page | 330 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He 
looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving. 

“You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he 
whispered to Hermione. 

“I did everything,” she whispered back, “Muffliato, 
Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of 
it. They shouldn’t be able to hear or see us, whoever 
they are.” 

Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of 
dislodged stones and twigs, told them that several 
people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope 
that descended to the narrow bank where they had 
pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The 
enchantments they had cast around themselves 
ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to 
shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal 
witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then 
perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by 
Dark Magic for the first time. 

The voices became louder but no more intelligible as 
the group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated 
that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, 
but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for 
sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and 
started to rummage; after a moment she drew out 
three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry 
and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh- 
colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends 
out of the tent entrance. 

Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. 

“There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you 
reckon it’s too early in the season? Accio Salmon).” 



Page | 331 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There were several distinct splashes and then the 
slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody 
grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable 
Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river 
he could make out more voices, but they were not 
speaking English or any human language he had ever 
heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a 
string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to 
be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower 
voice than the other. 

A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; 
large shadows passed between tent and flames. The 
delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly 
in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery 
on plates, and the first man spoke again. 

“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.” 

Goblins\ Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. 

“Thank you,” said the goblins together in English. 

“So, you three have been on the run how long?” asked 
a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely 
familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, 
cheerful-faced man. 

“Six weeks ... seven ... I forget,” said the tired man. 
“Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and 
joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have 
a bit of company.” There was a pause, while knives 
scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and 
replaced on the ground. “What made you leave, Ted?” 
continued the man. 

“Knew they were coming for me,” replied mellow- 
voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: 
Tonks’s father. “Heard Death Eaters were in the area 

Page | 332 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




last week and decided I’d better run for it. Refused to 
register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew 
it was a matter of time, knew I’d have to leave in the 
end. My wife should be okay, she’s pure-blood. And 
then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?” 

“Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione stared at each other, silent but beside 
themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the 
voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor. 

“Muggle-born, eh?” asked the first man. 

“Not sure,” said Dean. “My dad left my mum when I 
was a kid. I’ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.” 

There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of 
munching; then Ted spoke again. 

“I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. 
Pleased, but surprised. Word was you’d been caught.” 

“I was,” said Dirk. “I was halfway to Azkaban when I 
made a break for it, Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his 
broom. It was easier than you’d think; I don’t reckon 
he’s quite right at the moment. Might be Confunded. 

If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard 
who did it, probably saved my life.” 

There was another pause in which the fire crackled 
and the river rushed on. Then Ted said, “And where 
do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins 
were for You-Know-Who, on the whole.” 

“You had a false impression,” said the higher-voiced 
of the goblins. “We take no sides. This is a wizards’ 
war.” 

“How come you’re in hiding, then?” 

Page | 333 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I deemed it prudent,” said the deeper-voiced goblin. 
“Having refused what I considered an impertinent 
request, I could see that my personal safety was in 
jeopardy.” 

“What did they ask you to do?” asked Ted. 

“Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the 
goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said 
it. “I am not a house-elf.” 

“What about you, Griphook?” 

“Similar reasons,” said the higher-voiced goblin. 
“Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my 
race. I recognize no Wizarding master.” 

He added something under his breath in 
Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed. 

“What’s the joke?” asked Dean. 

“He said,” replied Dirk, “that there are things wizards 
don’t recognize, either.” 

There was a short pause. 

“I don’t get it,” said Dean. 

“I had my small revenge before I left,” said Griphook 
in English. 

“Good man — goblin, I should say,” amended Ted 
hastily. “Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in 
one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?” 

“If I had, the sword would not have helped him break 
out,” replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and 
even Dirk gave a dry chuckle. 

Page | 334 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Dean and I are still missing something here,” said 
Ted. 



“So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” 
said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with 
malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry’s breathing 
was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione stared 
at each other, listening as hard as they could. 

“Didn’t you hear about that, Ted?” asked Dirk. “About 
the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of 
Snape ’s office at Hogwarts?” 

An electric current seemed to course through Harry, 
jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the 
spot. 

“Never heard a word,” said Ted. “Not in the Prophet, 
was it?” 

“Hardly,” chortled Dirk. “Griphook here told me, he 
heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the 
bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was 
Bill’s younger sister.” 

Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of 
whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly 
as lifelines. 

“She and a couple of friends got into Snape ’s office 
and smashed open the glass case where he was 
apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as 
they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.” 

“Ah, God bless ’em,” said Ted. “What did they think, 
that they’d be able to use the sword on You-Know- 
Who? Or on Snape himself?” 



Page | 335 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, whatever they thought they were going to do 
with it, Snape decided the sword wasn’t safe where it 
was,” said Dirk. “Couple of days later, once he’d got 
the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it 
down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.” 

The goblins started to laugh again. 

“I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted. 

“It’s a fake,” rasped Griphook. 

“The sword of Gryffindor!” 

“Oh yes. It is a copy — an excellent copy, it is true — 
but it was Wizard-made. The original was forged 
centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties 
only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever the 
genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at 
Gringotts bank.” 

“I see,” said Ted. “And I take it you didn’t bother 
telling the Death Eaters this?” 

“I saw no reason to trouble them with the 
information,” said Griphook smugly, and now Ted and 
Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk’s laughter. 

Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone 
to ask the question he needed answered, and after a 
minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; he was (Harry 
remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginny’s 
too. 

“What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones 
who tried to steal it?” 

“Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,” said Griphook 
indifferently. 

Page | 336 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, 
the Weasleys don’t need any more of their kids 
injured, do they?” 

“They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am 
aware,” said Griphook. 

“Lucky for them,” said Ted. “With Snape’s track 
record I suppose we should just be glad they’re still 
alive.” 

“You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?” asked 
Dirk. “You believe Snape killed Dumbledore?” 

“ ’Course I do,” said Ted. “You’re not going to sit there 
and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with 
it?” 



“Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered 
Dirk. 

“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s 
the real thing — the Chosen One, or whatever you 
want to call it.” 

“Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, 
son,” said Dirk, “me included. But where is he? Run 
for it, by the looks of things. You’d think, if he knew 
anything we don’t, or had anything special going for 
him, he’d be out there now fighting, rallying 
resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the 
Prophet made a pretty good case against him — ” 

“The Prophet?” scoffed Ted. “You deserve to be lied to 
if you’re still reading that muck, Dirk. You want the 
facts, try the Quibbler.” 

There was a sudden explosion of choking and 
retching, plus a good deal of thumping; by the sound 

Page | 337 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




of it, Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he 
spluttered, “The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno 
Lovegood’s?” 

“It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “You want to 
give it a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the 
Prophet’s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple- 
Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they’ll 
let him get away with it, mind, I don’t know. But Xeno 
says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who’s 
against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry 
Potter their number-one priority.” 

“Hard to help a boy who’s vanished off the face of the 
earth,” said Dirk. 

“Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s 
one hell of an achievement,” said Ted. “I’d take tips 
from him gladly; it’s what we’re trying to do, stay free, 
isn’t it?” 

“Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk 
heavily. “With the whole of the Ministry and all their 
informers looking for him I’d have expected him to be 
caught by now. Mind, who’s to say they haven’t 
already caught and killed him without publicizing it?” 

“Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted. 

There was a long pause filled with more clattering of 
knives and forks. When they spoke again it was to 
discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or 
retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees 
would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, 
then clambered back up the incline, their voices 
fading away. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable 
Ears. Harry, who had found the need to remain silent 

Page | 338 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, 
now found himself unable to say more than, “Ginny 
— the sword — ” 

“I know!” said Hermione. 

She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking 
her arm in it right up to the armpit. 

“Here ... we ... are ...” she said between gritted teeth, 
and she pulled at something that was evidently in the 
depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate 
picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help 
her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas 
Nigellus free of Hermione’s bag, she kept her wand 
pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment. 

“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake 
while it was in Dumbledore’s office,” she panted, as 
they propped the painting against the side of the tent, 
“Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he 
hangs right beside the case!” 

“Unless he was asleep,” said Harry, but he still held 
his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the 
empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared 
her throat, then said: 

“Er — Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?” 

Nothing happened. 

“Phineas Nigellus?” said Hermione again. “Professor 
Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?” 

“ ‘Please’ always helps,” said a cold, snide voice, and 
Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. At once, 
Hermione cried: 



Page | 339 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Obscuro\” 



A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus’s 
clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into the frame 
and shriek with pain. 

“What — how dare — what are you — ?” 

“I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but 
it’s a necessary precaution!” 

“Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! 
You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? 

What is going on?” 

“Never mind where we are,” said Harry, and Phineas 
Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the 
painted blindfold. 

“Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. 
Potter?” 

“Maybe,” said Harry, knowing that this would keep 
Phineas Nigellus’s interest. “We’ve got a couple of 
questions to ask you — about the sword of 
Gryffindor.” 

“Ah,” said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this 
way and that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, “yes. 
That silly girl acted most unwisely there — ” 

“Shut up about my sister,” said Ron roughly. Phineas 
Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows. 

“Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from 
side to side. “Your tone displeases me! The girl and 
her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving 
from the headmaster!” 



Page | 340 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“They weren’t thieving,” said Harry. “That sword isn’t 
Snape’s.” 

“It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas 
Nigellus. “Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl 
have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did 
the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!” 

“Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!” 
said Hermione. 

“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to 
wrestle with the blindfold again. “Where have you 
brought me? Why have you removed me from the 
house of my forebears?” 

“Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, 
Neville, and Luna?” asked Harry urgently. 

“Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, 
to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.” 

“Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly. 

“And Snape might’ve thought that was a 
punishment,” said Harry, “but Ginny, Neville, and 
Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The 
Forbidden Forest ... they’ve faced plenty worse than 
the Forbidden Forest, big deal!” 

He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the 
Cruciatus Curse at the very least. 

“What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is 
whether anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at 
all? Maybe it’s been taken away for cleaning or — or 
something?” 



Page | 341 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free 
his eyes and sniggered. 

“ Muggle-borns,” he said. “Goblin-made armor does not 
require cleaning, simple girl. Goblins’ silver repels 
mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens 
it.” 

“Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry. 

“I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. 
“Perhaps it is time for me to return to the 
headmaster’s office?” 

Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his 
frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture and 
back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden 
inspiration. 

“Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?” 

“I beg your pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus. 

“Professor Dumbledore’s portrait — couldn’t you bring 
him along, here, into yours?” 

Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of 
Harry’s voice. 

“Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are 
ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may 
commune with each other, but they cannot travel 
outside the castle except to visit a painting of 
themselves hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot 
come here with me, and after the treatment I have 
received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall 
not be making a return visit!” 



Page | 342 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble 
his attempts to leave his frame. 

“Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just 
tell us, please, when was the last time the sword was 
taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I 
mean?” 

Phineas snorted impatiently. 

“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of 
Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor 
Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.” 

Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of 
them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who 
had at last managed to locate the exit. 

“Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, 
and he began to move out of sight again. Only the 
edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry 
gave a sudden shout. 

“Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?” 

Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into 
the picture. 

“Professor Snape has more important things on his 
mind than the many eccentricities of Albus 
Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!” 

And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind 
him nothing but his murky backdrop. 

“Harry!” Hermione cried. 

“I know!” Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, 
he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to 

Page | 343 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that 
he could have run a mile; he did not even feel hungry 
anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s 
portrait back into the beaded bag; when she had 
fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised 
a shining face to Harry. 

“The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made 
blades imbibe only that which strengthen them — 
Harry, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk 
venom!” 

“And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still 
needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket — ” 

“ — and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you 
have it if he put it in his will — ” 

“ — so he made a copy — ” 

“ — and put a fake in the glass case — ” 

“ — and he left the real one — where?” 

They gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer 
was dangling invisibly in the air above them, 
tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? 
Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not 
realized it at the time? 

“Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would 
he have left it?” 

“Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing. 

“Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione. 

“The Shrieking Shack?” said Harry. “Nobody ever goes 
in there.” 

Page | 344 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a 
bit risky?” 

“Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her. 

“Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the 
swords,” said Hermione. 

“Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more 
cheered at the thought that Dumbledore had had 
some reservations, however faint, about Snape ’s 
trustworthiness. “So, would he have hidden the sword 
well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d’you reckon, 
Ron? Ron?” 

Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he 
thought that Ron had left the tent, then realized that 
Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking 
stony. 

“Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said. 

“What?” 

Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the 
upper bunk. 

“You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.” 

Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she 
shook her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was. 

“What’s the problem?” asked Harry. 

“Problem? There’s no problem,” said Ron, still 
refusing to look at Harry. “Not according to you, 
anyway.” 



Page | 345 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There were several plunks on the canvas over their 
heads. It had started to rain. 



“Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry. 
“Spit it out, will you?” 

Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He 
looked mean, unlike himself. 

“All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up 
and down the tent because there’s some other damn 
thing we’ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff 
you don’t know.” 

“I don’t know?” repeated Harry, “I don’t know?” 

Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and 
heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around 
them and into the river chattering through the dark. 
Dread doused Harry’s jubilation: Ron was saying 
exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be 
thinking. 

“It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” 
said Ron, “you know, with my arm mangled and 
nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every 
night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been 
running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved 
something.” 

“Ron,” Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that 
Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud 
tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent. 

“I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said 
Harry. 

“Yeah, I thought I did too.” 

Page | 346 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“So what part of it isn’t living up to your 
expectations?” asked Harry. Anger was coming to his 
defense now. “Did you think we’d be staying in five- 
star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did 
you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?” 

“We thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted 
Ron, standing up, and his words pierced Harry like 
scalding knives. “We thought Dumbledore had told 
you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!” 

“Ron!” said Hermione, this time clearly audible over 
the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he 
ignored her. 

“Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice 
quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate. 

“I’ve been straight with you from the start, I told you 
everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you 
haven’t noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux — ” 

“Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we 
are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, 
in other words!” 

“Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice 
unusually high. “Please take it off. You wouldn’t be 
talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day.” 

“Yeah, he would,” said Harry, who did not want 
excuses made for Ron. “D’you think I haven’t noticed 
the two of you whispering behind my back? D’you 
think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?” 

“Harry, we weren’t — ” 

“Don’t lie!” Ron hurled at her. “You said it too, you 
said you were disappointed, you said you’d thought 
he had a bit more to go on than — ” 

Page | 347 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I didn’t say it like that — Harry, I didn’t!” she cried. 



The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring 
down Hermione’s face, and the excitement of a few 
minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a 
short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving 
everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of 
Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and they 
were three teenagers in a tent whose only 
achievement was not, yet, to be dead. 

“So why are you still here?” Harry asked Ron. 

“Search me,” said Ron. 

“Go home then,” said Harry. 

“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took 
several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. 
“Didn’t you hear what they said about my sister? But 
you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only the 
Forbidden Forest, Harry I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter 
doesn’t care what happens to her in here — well, I do, 
all right, giant spiders and mental stuff — ” 

“I was only saying — she was with the others, they 
were with Hagrid — ” 

“Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the 
rest of my family, ‘the Weasleys don’t need another 
kid injured,’ did you hear that?” 

“Yeah, I — ” 

“Not bothered what it meant, though?” 

“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. 
“I don’t think it means anything new has happened, 
anything we don’t know about; think, Ron, Bill’s 

Page | 348 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that 
George has lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed 
to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I’m sure 
that’s all he meant — ” 

“Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t 
bother myself about them. It’s all right for you two, 
isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the way — ” 

“My parents are dead).” Harry bellowed. 

“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron. 

“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend 
you’ve got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be 
able to feed you up and — ” 

Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but 
before either wand was clear of its owner’s pocket, 
Hermione had raised her own. 

“Protego\” she cried, and an invisible shield expanded 
between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on 
the other; all of them were forced backward a few 
steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron 
glared from either side of the transparent barrier as 
though they were seeing each other clearly for the 
first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: 
Something had broken between them. 

“Leave the Horcrux,” Harry said. 

Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast 
the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to 
Hermione. 

“What are you doing?” 

“What do you mean?” 

Page | 349 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Are you staying, or what?” 

“I ...” She looked anguished. “Yes — yes, I’m staying. 
Ron, we said we’d go with Harry, we said we’d help — ” 

“I get it. You choose him.” 

“Ron, no — please — come back, come back!” 

She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the 
time she had removed it he had already stormed into 
the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening 
to her sobbing and calling Ron’s name amongst the 
trees. 

After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair 
plastered to her face. 

“He’s g-g-gone! Disapparated!” 

She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started 
to cry. 

Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, 
and placed it around his own neck. He dragged 
blankets off Ron’s bunk and threw them over 
Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed and 
stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the 
pounding of the rain.

GODRIC’S HOLLOW 

When Harry woke the following day it was several 
seconds before he remembered what had happened. 
Then he hoped, childishly, that it had been a dream, 
that Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by 
turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron’s 
deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way it 
seemed to draw his eyes. Harry jumped down from 
his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron’s. 
Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did 
not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face 
away quickly as he went by. 

He’s gone, Harry told himself. He’s gone. He had to 
keep thinking it as he washed and dressed, as though 
repetition would dull the shock of it. He’s gone and 
he’s not coming back. And that was the simple truth 
of it, Harry knew, because their protective 
enchantments meant that it would be impossible, 
once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them 
again. 



Page | 351 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione ’s 
eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not 
slept. They packed up their things, Hermione 
dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out 
their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her 
look up eagerly, and he was sure she had deluded 
herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through 
the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appeared 
between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, 
looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, 
himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, 
another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He 
could hear Ron saying, “ We thought you knew what 
you were doing \” , and he resumed packing with a 
hard knot in the pit of his stomach. 

The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and 
would soon spill over onto their bank. They had 
lingered a good hour after they would usually have 
departed their campsite. Finally having entirely 
repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione 
seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: She 
and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated, 
reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside. 

The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry’s 
hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down 
on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with 
what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing 
that he ought to go and comfort her, but something 
kept him rooted to the spot. Everything inside him felt 
cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous 
expression on Ron’s face. Harry strode off through the 
heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught 
Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually 
performed to ensure their protection. 

They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few 
days. Harry was determined never to mention his 

Page | 352 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it 
was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at 
night when she thought he was sleeping, he would 
hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had started 
bringing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by 
wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when 
Ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of 
Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the 
comfortable castle, protected by his status of 
pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map, 
and after a while Harry found himself taking it out 
simply to stare at Ginny’s name in the girls’ 
dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with 
which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that 
she would somehow know he was thinking about her, 
hoping that she was all right. 

By day, they devoted themselves to trying to 
determine the possible locations of Gryffindor’s 
sword, but the more they talked about the places in 
which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more 
desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. 
Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not 
remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in 
which he might hide something. There were moments 
when he did not know whether he was angrier with 
Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what 
you were doing. . . . We thought Dumbledore had told 
you what to do. . . . We thought you had a real plan\ 

He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. 
Dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing. They 
had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means 
of destroying it: The others were as unattainable as 
they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to 
engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own 
presumption in accepting his friends’ offers to 
accompany him on this meandering, pointless 
journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he 
Page | 353 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




was constantly, painfully on the alert for any 
indication that Hermione too was about to tell him 
that she had had enough, that she was leaving. 

They were spending many evenings in near silence, 
and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s 
portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he 
might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron’s 
departure. Despite his previous assertion that he 
would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not 
seem able to resist the chance to find out more about 
what Harry was up to, and consented to reappear, 
blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad 
to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide 
and taunting kind. They relished any news about 
what was happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas 
Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated 
Snape, the first Slytherin headmaster since he 
himself had controlled the school, and they had to be 
careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions 
about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly 
leave his painting. 

However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape 
seemed to be facing a constant, low level of mutiny 
from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned 
from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated 
Umbridge’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three 
or more students or any unofficial student societies. 

From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, 
and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had 
been doing their best to continue Dumbledore’s Army. 
This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so 
badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him 
think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of 
Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as 
his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked 
about Snape ’s crackdown, Harry experienced a split 
Page | 354 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




second of madness when he imagined simply going 
back to school to join the destabilization of Snape’s 
regime: Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other 
people being in charge, seemed the most wonderful 
prospect in the world at that moment. But then he 
remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, 
that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his 
head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was 
just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of 
Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently 
emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions 
about Harry and Hermione’s whereabouts. Hermione 
shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he 
did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to 
reappear for several days after these unceremonious 
good-byes. 

The weather grew colder and colder. They did not 
dare remain in any one area too long, so rather than 
staying in the south of England, where a hard ground 
frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to 
meander up and down the country, braving a 
mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, 
flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill 
water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish 
loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night. 

They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling 
from several sitting room windows before there came 
an evening when Harry resolved to suggest, again, 
what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left 
to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal: 
Hermione had been to a supermarket under the 
Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money 
into an open till as she left), and Harry thought that 
she might be more persuadable than usual on a 
stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. 
He had also had the foresight to suggest that they 
take a few hours’ break from wearing the Horcrux, 
Page | 355 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside 
him. 



“Hermione?” 

“Hmm?” She was curled up in one of the sagging 
armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He could 
not imagine how much more she could get out of the 
book, which was not, after all, very long; but evidently 
she was still deciphering something in it, because 
Spellman’s Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair. 

Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had 
done on the occasion, several years previously, when 
he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could 
go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not 
persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip. 

“Hermione, I’ve been thinking, and — ” 

“Harry, could you help me with something?” 

Apparently she had not been listening to him. She 
leaned forward and held out The Tales of Beedle the 
Bard. 

“Look at that symbol,” she said, pointing to the top of 
a page. Above what Harry assumed was the title of 
the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be 
sure) , there was a picture of what looked like a 
triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line. 

“I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.” 

“I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the 
syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a picture 
of an eye, but I don’t think it is! It’s been inked in, 
look, somebody’s drawn it there, it isn’t really part of 
the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?” 

Page | 356 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No ... No, wait a moment.” Harry looked closer. “Isn’t 
it the same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his 
neck?” 



“Well, that’s what I thought too!” 

“Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.” 

She stared at him, openmouthed. 

“What?” 

“Krum told me ...” 

He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him 
at the wedding. Hermione looked astonished. 

“ Grindelwald’s mark?” 

She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back 
again. “I’ve never heard that Grindelwald had a mark. 
There’s no mention of it in anything I’ve ever read 
about him.” 

“Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was 
carved on a wall at Durmstrang, and Grindelwald put 
it there.” 

She fell back into the old armchair, frowning. 

“That’s very odd. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s 
it doing in a book of children’s stories?” 

“Yeah, it is weird,” said Harry. “And you’d think 
Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was 
Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.” 



Page | 357 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I know. ... Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like 
I did. All the other stories have little pictures over the 
titles.” 



She did not speak, but continued to pore over the 
strange mark. Harry tried again. 

“Hermione?” 

“Hmm?” 

“I’ve been thinking. I — I want to go to Godric’s 
Hollow.” 

She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, 
and he was sure she was still thinking about the 
mysterious mark on the book. 

“Yes,” she said. “Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I 
really think we’ll have to.” 

“Did you hear me right?” he asked. 

“Of course I did. You want to go to Godric’s Hollow. I 
agree, I think we should. I mean, I can’t think of 
anywhere else it could be either. It’ll be dangerous, 
but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems 
it’s there.” 

“Er — what’s there?” asked Harry. 

At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt. 

“Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have 
known you’d want to go back there, and I mean, 
Godric’s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor’s birthplace — ” 

“Really? Gryffindor came from Godric’s Hollow?” 

Page | 358 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?” 



“Erm,” he said, smiling for what felt like the first time 
in months: The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. “I 
might’ve opened it, you know, when I bought it ... just 
the once. ...” 

“Well, as the village is named after him I’d have 
thought you might have made the connection,” said 
Hermione. She sounded much more like her old self 
than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to 
announce that she was off to the library. “There’s a 
bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait ...” 

She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a 
while, finally extracting her copy of their old school 
textbook, A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, 
which she thumbed through until finding the page 
she wanted. 

“ ‘Upon the signature of the International Statute of 
Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It 
was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own 
small communities within a community. Many small 
villages and hamlets attracted several magical 
families, who banded together for mutual support and 
protection. The villages of Tinworth in Cornwall, Upper 
Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the 
south coast of England were notable homes to knots of 
Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and 
sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of 
these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, 

Godric’s Hollow, the West Country village where the 
great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where 
Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first 
Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of 
ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, 
for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little 
church beside it for many centuries.’ 

Page | 359 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione 
said, closing the book, “because Professor Bagshot 
doesn’t cover anything later than the end of the 
nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hollow, 
Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think 
Dumbledore would have expected you to make the 
connection?” 

“Oh yeah ...” 

Harry did not want to admit that he had not been 
thinking about the sword at all when he suggested 
they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the lure of the 
village lay in his parents’ graves, the house where he 
had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of 
Bathilda Bagshot. 

“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually. 
“Who?” 

“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say 
Ron’s name. “Ginny’s great-aunt. At the wedding. The 
one who said you had skinny ankles.” 

“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry 
knew that she had sensed Ron’s name in the offing. 
He rushed on: 

“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s 
Hollow.” 

“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running 
her index finger over Bathilda’s embossed name on 
the front cover of A History of Magic. “Well, I suppose 



She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides 
turned over; he drew his wand, looking around at the 

Page | 360 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way 
through the entrance flap, but there was nothing 
there. 

“What?” he said, half angry, half relieved. “What did 
you do that for? I thought you’d seen a Death Eater 
unzipping the tent, at least — ” 

“Harry, what if Bathilda’ s got the sword? What if 
Dumbledore entrusted it to her?” 

Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be 
an extremely old woman by now, and according to 
Muriel, she was “gaga.” Was it likely that Dumbledore 
would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? 

If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal 
to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he 
had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so 
much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, 
however, was not the moment to cast doubt on 
Hermione’s theory, not when she was so surprisingly 
willing to fall in with Harry’s dearest wish. 

“Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to 
Godric’s Hollow?” 

“Yes, but we’ll have to think it through carefully, 
Harry.” She was sitting up now, and Harry could tell 
that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her 
mood as much as his. “We’ll need to practice 
Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for 
a start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would 
be sensible too, unless you think we should go the 
whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we’ll 
need to collect hair from somebody. I actually think 
we’d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises 
the better. ...” 



Page | 361 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever 
there was a pause, but his mind had left the 
conversation. For the first time since he had 
discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he 
felt excited. 

He was about to go home, about to return to the place 
where he had had a family. It was in Godric’s Hollow 
that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and 
spent every school holiday. He could have invited 
friends to his house. ... He might even have had 
brothers and sisters. ... It would have been his 
mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. 
The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to 
him as at this moment, when he knew he was about 
to see the place where it had been taken from him. 
After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry 
quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione ’s 
beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album 
Hagrid had given him so long ago. For the first time in 
months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, 
smiling and waving up at him from the images, which 
were all he had left of them now. 

Harry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow 
the following day, but Hermione had other ideas. 
Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect 
Harry to return to the scene of his parents’ deaths, 
she was determined that they would set off only after 
they had ensured that they had the best disguises 
possible. It was therefore a full week later — once 
they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent 
Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had 
practiced Apparating and Disapparating while 
underneath the Invisibility Cloak together — that 
Hermione agreed to make the journey. 

They were to Apparate to the village under cover of 
darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally 

Page | 362 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a 
balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his 
small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag 
containing all of their possessions (apart from the 
Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) 
was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione ’s 
buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak 
over them, then they turned into the suffocating 
darkness once again. 

Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. 
They were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane 
under a dark blue sky, in which the night’s first stars 
were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on 
either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations 
twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of 
them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the 
center of the village. 

“All this snow!” Hermione whispered beneath the 
cloak. “Why didn’t we think of snow? After all our 
precautions, we’ll leave prints! We’ll just have to get 
rid of them — you go in front, I’ll do it — ” 

Harry did not want to enter the village like a 
pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves 
concealed while magically covering their traces. 

“Let’s take off the Cloak,” said Harry, and when she 
looked frightened, “Oh, come on, we don’t look like us 
and there’s no one around.” 

He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made 
their way forward unhampered, the icy air stinging 
their faces as they passed more cottages: Any one of 
them might have been the one in which James and 
Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry 
gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, 
and their front porches, wondering whether he 
Page | 363 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it 
was impossible, that he had been little more than a 
year old when he had left this place forever. He was 
not even sure whether he would be able to see the 
cottage at all; he did not know what happened when 
the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little 
lane along which they were walking curved to the left 
and the heart of the village, a small square, was 
revealed to them. 

Strung all around with colored lights, there was what 
looked like a war memorial in the middle, partly 
obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were 
several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church 
whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel- 
bright across the square. 

The snow here had become impacted: It was hard and 
slippery where people had trodden on it all day. 
Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their 
figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps. They heard 
a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door 
opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up 
inside the little church. 

“Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione. 

“Is it?” 

He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a 
newspaper for weeks. 

“I’m sure it is,” said Hermione, her eyes upon the 
church. “They ... they’ll be in there, won’t they? Your 
mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.” 

Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond 
excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so near, 
he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. 

Page | 364 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, because 
she reached for his hand and took the lead for the 
first time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the 
square, however, she stopped dead. 

“Harry, look!” 

She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had 
passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an obelisk 
covered in names, there was a statue of three people: 
a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with 
long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy 
sitting in his mother’s arms. Snow lay upon all their 
heads, like fluffy white caps. 

Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces. 
He had never imagined that there would be a statue. 

. . . How strange it was to see himself represented in 
stone, a happy baby without a scar on his forehead. 



“C’mon,” said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and 
they turned again toward the church. As they crossed 
the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had 
turned back into the war memorial. 

The singing grew louder as they approached the 
church. It made Harry’s throat constrict, it reminded 
him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing 
rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of 
the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of 
Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a 
cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater. . . . 

There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the 
graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as 
possible and they edged through it. On either side of 
the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay 
deep and untouched. They moved off through the 
Page | 365 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




snow, carving deep trenches behind them as they 
walked around the building, keeping to the shadows 
beneath the brilliant windows. 

Behind the church, row upon row of snowy 
tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue 
that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green 
wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the 
snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in 
his jacket pocket, Harry moved toward the nearest 
grave. 

“Look at this, it’s an Abbott, could be some long-lost 
relation of Hannah’s!” 

“Keep your voice down,” Hermione begged him. 

They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, 
gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them, 
stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, 
every now and then squinting into the surrounding 
darkness to make absolutely sure that they were 
unaccompanied . 

“Harry, here!” 

Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had 
to wade back to her, his heart positively banging in 
his chest. 

“Is it — ?” 



“No, but look!” 

She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down 
and saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the 
words KENDRA DUMBLEDORE and, a short way 
below her dates of birth and death, AND HER 
DAUGHTER ARIANA. There was also a quotation: 
Page | 366 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 



So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts 
right. The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, 
and part of it had died here. 

Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. 
Harry could not help thinking that he and 
Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, 
and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet 
he had never thought to share the connection. They 
could have visited the place together; for a moment 
Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of 
what a bond that would have been, of how much it 
would have meant to him. But it seemed that to 
Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by 
side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant 
coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted 
Harry to do. 

Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that 
his face was hidden in shadow. He read the words on 
the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there 
will your heart be also. He did not understand what 
these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen 
them, as the eldest member of the family once his 
mother had died. 

“Are you sure he never mentioned — ?” Hermione 
began. 

“No,” said Harry curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and 
he turned away, wishing he had not seen the stone: 

He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with 
resentment. 

“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later 
from out of the darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it 
said Potter.” 

Page | 367 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing 
down at it, a little frown on her face. 



“Harry, come back a moment.” 

He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only 
grudgingly made his way back through the snow 
toward her. 

“What?” 

“Look at this!” 

The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry 
could hardly make out the name. Hermione showed 
him the symbol beneath it. 

“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!” 

He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was 
so worn that it was hard to make out what was 
engraved there, though there did seem to be a 
triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name. 

“Yeah ... it could be. ...” 

Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on 
the headstone. 

“It says Ig — Ignotus, I think. ...” 

“I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” 
Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set 
off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave. 

Every now and then he recognized a surname that, 
like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there 
were several generations of the same Wizarding family 
represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from 

Page | 368 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the dates that it had either died out, or the current 
members had moved away from Godric’s Hollow. 
Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and 
every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little 
lurch of apprehension and anticipation. 

The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of 
a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked around, 
worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the 
carols had finished, that the chatter and flurry of 
churchgoers were fading away as they made their way 
back into the square. Somebody inside the church 
had just turned off the lights. 

Then Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for 
the third time, sharp and clear from a few yards 
away. 

“Harry, they’re here ... right here.” 

And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and 
father this time: He moved toward her, feeling as if 
something heavy were pressing on his chest, the 
same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore 
had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his 
heart and lungs. 

The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and 
Ariana’s. It was made of white marble, just like 
Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as 
it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to 
kneel or even approach very close to it to make out 
the words engraved upon it. 

JAMES POTTER

LILY POTTER 

BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 

Page | 369 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 



The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 

Harry read the words slowly, as though he would 
have only one chance to take in their meaning, and 
he read the last of them aloud. 

“ The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’...” 

A horrible thought came to him, and with it a kind of 
panic. “Isn’t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that 
there?” 

“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death 
Eaters mean it, Harry,” said Hermione, her voice 
gentle. “It means ... you know ... living beyond death. 
Living after death.” 

But they were not living, thought Harry: They were 
gone. The empty words could not disguise the fact 
that his parents’ moldering remains lay beneath snow 
and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came 
before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly 
freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping 
them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips 
pressed hard together, looking down at the thick 
snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of 
Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not 
knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, 
his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice 
and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was 
sleeping under the snow with them. 

Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping 
it tightly. He could not look at her, but returned the 
pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night 
air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain control. 
He should have brought something to give them, and 
he had not thought of it, and every plant in the 
Page | 370 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione 
raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air, 
and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before 
them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents’ 
grave. 

As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not 
think he could stand another moment there. He put 
his arm around Hermione’s shoulders, and she put 
hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and 
walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore’s 
mother and sister, back toward the dark church and 
the out-of-sight kissing gate.

BATHILDA’S SECRET 

“Harry, stop.” 

“What’s wrong?” 

They had only just reached the grave of the unknown 
Abbott. 

“There’s someone there. Someone watching us. I can 
tell. There, over by the bushes.” 

They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing 
at the dense black boundary of the graveyard. Harry 
could not see anything. 

“Are you sure?” 

“I saw something move, I could have sworn I did. ...” 
She broke from him to free her wand arm. 

“We look like Muggles,” Harry pointed out. 



Page | 372 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“Muggles who ’ve just been laying flowers on your 
parents’ grave! Harry, I’m sure there’s someone over 
there!” 



Harry thought of A History of Magic ; the graveyard 
was supposed to be haunted: what if — ? But then he 
heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow 
in the bush to which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts 
could not move snow. 

“It’s a cat,” said Harry, after a second or two, “or a 
bird. If it was a Death Eater we’d be dead by now. But 
let’s get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back 
on.” 

They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way 
out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as 
sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring 
Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery 
pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over 
themselves. The pub was fuller than before: Many 
voices inside it were now singing the carol that they 
had heard as they approached the church. For a 
moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge 
inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione 
murmured, “Let’s go this way,” and pulled him down 
the dark street leading out of the village in the 
opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry 
could make out the point where the cottages ended 
and the lane turned into open country again. They 
walked as quickly as they dared, past more windows 
sparkling with multicolored lights, the outlines of 
Christmas trees dark through the curtains. 

“How are we going to find Bathilda’s house?” asked 
Hermione, who was shivering a little and kept 
glancing back over her shoulder. “Harry? What do you 
think? Harry?” 

Page | 373 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




She tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying 
attention. He was looking toward the dark mass that 
stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next 
moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione along 
with him; she slipped a little on the ice. 

“Harry — ” 

“Look. ... Look at it, Hermione. ...” 

“I don’t ... oh!” 

He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died 
with James and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the 
sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the 
rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high 
grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though 
entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right 
side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry 
was sure, was where the curse had backfired. He and 
Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of 
what must once have been a cottage just like those 
that flanked it. 

“I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered 
Hermione. 

“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied. “Maybe 
it’s like the injuries from Dark Magic and you can’t 
repair the damage?” 

He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and 
grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not 
wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the 
house. 

“You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it 
might — oh, Harry, look!” 



Page | 374 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign 
had risen out of the ground in front of them, up 
through the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some 
bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden letters 
upon the wood it said: 



On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1 981, Lily and 
James Potter lost their lives. Their son, Harry, remains 
the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse. 
This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left in its 
ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a 
reminder of the violence that tore apart their family. 

And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles 
had been added by other witches and wizards who 
had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived 
had escaped. Some had merely signed their names in 
Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into 
the wood, still others had left messages. The most 
recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years’ 
worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things. 

Good luck, Harry, wherever you are. 

If you read this, Harry, we’re all behind you! 

Long live Harry Potter. 

“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said 
Hermione, indignant. 

But Harry beamed at her. 

“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I ...” 

He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up 
the lane toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights 

Page | 375 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was 
hard to judge, that the figure was a woman. She was 
moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the 
snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling 
gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They 
watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was 
waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the 
cottages she was passing, but he knew instinctively 
that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few 
yards from them and simply stood there in the middle 
of the frozen road, facing them. 

He did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm. There 
was next to no chance that this woman was a Muggle: 
She was standing there gazing at a house that ought 
to have been completely invisible to her, if she was 
not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, 
however, it was odd behavior to come out on a night 
this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the 
rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to 
be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, 
Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that 
they were there, and also who they were. Just as he 
had reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a 
gloved hand and beckoned. 

Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her 
arm pressed against his. 

“How does she know?” 

He shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more 
vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to 
obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her 
identity were growing stronger every moment that 
they stood facing each other in the deserted street. 

Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all 
these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to 

Page | 376 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it 
not likely that it was she who had moved in the 
shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to 
this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested 
some Dumbledore-ish power that he had never 
encountered before. 

Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and 
jump. 

“Are you Bathilda?” 

The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. 

Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at 
each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave 
a tiny, nervous nod. 

They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she 
turned and hobbled off back the way they had come. 
Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a 
gate. They followed her up the front path through a 
garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just 
left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front 
door, then opened it and stepped back to let them 
pass. 

She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry 
wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled 
off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized 
how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came 
barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind 
them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the 
peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry’s 
face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken 
into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was 
dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He 
wondered whether she could make him out at all; 



Page | 377 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose 
identity he had stolen that she would see. 

The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and 
stale food intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten 
black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair 
through which the scalp showed clearly. 

“Bathilda?” Harry repeated. 

She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket 
against his skin; the thing inside it that sometimes 
ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing 
through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, 
that the thing that would destroy it was near? 

Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside 
as though she had not seen her, and vanished into 
what seemed to be a sitting room. 

“Harry, I’m not sure about this,” breathed Hermione. 

“Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower 
her if we had to,” said Harry. “Listen, I should have 
told you, I knew she wasn’t all there. Muriel called her 
‘gaga.’ ” 

“Come!” called Bathilda from the next room. 

Hermione jumped and clutched Harry’s arm. 

“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the 
way into the sitting room. 

Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting 
candles, but it was still very dark, not to mention 
extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their 
feet, and Harry’s nose detected, underneath the dank 
and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone 
Page | 378 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




bad. He wondered when was the last time anyone had 
been inside Bathilda’s house to check whether she 
was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she 
could do magic, too, for she lit the candles clumsily 
by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of 
catching fire. 

“Let me do that,” offered Harry, and he took the 
matches from her. She stood watching him as he 
finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on 
saucers around the room, perched precariously on 
stacks of books and on side tables crammed with 
cracked and moldy cups. 

The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was 
a bow-fronted chest of drawers on which there stood 
a large number of photographs. When the flame 
danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty 
glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from 
the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the 
fire, he muttered “ Tergeo ”: The dust vanished from 
the photographs, and he saw at once that half a 
dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate 
frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody 
else had removed them. Then the sight of a 
photograph near the back of the collection caught his 
eye, and he snatched it up. 

It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young 
man who had perched on Gregorovitch’s windowsill, 
smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And 
it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy 
before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm 
in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must 
be where all the missing photographs were: in Rita’s 
book. 

“Mrs. — Miss — Bagshot?” he said, and his voice 
shook slightly. “Who is this?” 

Page | 379 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room 
watching Hermione light the fire for her. 

“Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced 
with the picture in his hands as the flames burst into 
life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, 
and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest. 

“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the 
picture forward. 

She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry. 

“Do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much 
slower and louder voice than usual. “This man? Do 
you know him? What’s he called?” 

Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful 
frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda’s 
memories? 

“Who is this man?” he repeated loudly. 

“Harry, what are you doing?” asked Hermione. 

“This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who 
stole from Gregorovitch! Please!” he said to Bathilda. 
“Who is this?” 

But she only stared at him. 

“Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. — Miss 
— Bagshot?” asked Hermione, raising her own voice. 
“Was there something you wanted to tell us?” 

Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda 
now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry. With a little 
jerk of her head she looked back into the hall. 



Page | 380 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You want us to leave?” he asked. 



She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at 
him, then at herself, then at the ceiling. 

“Oh, right ... Hermione, I think she wants me to go 
upstairs with her.” 

“All right,” said Hermione, “let’s go.” 

But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head 
with surprising vigor, once more pointing first at 
Harry, then to herself. 

“She wants me to go with her, alone.” 

“Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp 
and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her 
head a little at the loud noise. 

“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, 
and only to me?” 

“Do you really think she knows who you are?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes 
fixed upon his own, “I think she does.” 

“Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.” 

“Lead the way,” Harry told Bathilda. 

She seemed to understand, because she shuffled 
around him toward the door. Harry glanced back at 
Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not 
sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself in the 
midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the 
bookcase. As Harry walked out of the room, unseen 
by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the silver- 

P a g e | 381 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his 
jacket. 

The stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half 
tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda’s 
backside to ensure that she did not topple over 
backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely. 
Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper 
landing, turned immediately right, and led him into a 
low-ceilinged bedroom. 

It was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had 
just made out a chamber pot protruding from under 
the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that 
was swallowed by the darkness. 

“Lumos,” said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a 
start: Bathilda had moved close to him in those few 
seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her 
approach. 

“You are Potter?” she whispered. 

“Yes, I am.” 

She nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux 
beating fast, faster than his own heart: It was an 
unpleasant, agitating sensation. 

“Have you got anything for me?” Harry asked, but she 
seemed distracted by his lit wand-tip. 

“Have you got anything for me?” he repeated. 

Then she closed her eyes and several things 
happened at once: Harry’s scar prickled painfully; the 
Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater 
actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved 



Page | 382 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, 
cold voice: Hold him). 

Harry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling 
room seemed to close around him again; he did not 
know what had just happened. 

“Have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third 
time, much louder. 

“Over here,” she whispered, pointing to the corner. 
Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a 
cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained 
window. 

This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between 
her and the unmade bed, his wand raised. He did not 
want to look away from her. 

“What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing 
table, which was heaped high with what looked and 
smelled like dirty laundry. 

“There,” she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. 

And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes 
raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she 
moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; 
panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he 
saw the old body collapsing and the great snake 
pouring from the place where her neck had been. 

The snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of 
the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up 
toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around 
the room and was extinguished: Then a powerful blow 
from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of 
him: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into 
the mound of filthy clothing — 

Page | 383 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake’s tail, 
which thrashed down upon the table where he had 
been a second earlier: Fragments of the glass surface 
rained upon him as he hit the floor. From below he 
heard Hermione call, “Harry?” 

He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call 
back: Then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the 
floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular 



“No!” he gasped, pinned to the floor. 

“Yes,” whispered the voice. “Yesss ... hold you ... hold 
you ...” 

“Accio ... Accio Wand ...” 

But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try 
to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around 
his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the 
Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice that 
throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, 
and his brain was flooding with cold, white light, all 
thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant 
footsteps, everything going. ... 

A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now 
he was flying, flying with triumph in his heart, 
without need of broomstick or thestral. ... 

He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling 
darkness; Nagini had released him. He scrambled up 
and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: 
It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek; her 
deflected curse hit the curtained window, which 
shattered. Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked 
to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot 
slipped on a pencil-like something — his wand — 
Page | 384 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was 
full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione was 
nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought 
the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash 
of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking 
Harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil 
rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as 
he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more 
powerfully than it had done in years. 

“He’s coming! Hermione, he’s comingl” 

As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything 
was chaos: It smashed shelves from the wall, and 
splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped 
over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be 
Hermione — 

She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across 
the bed: The snake reared again, but Harry knew that 
worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps 
already at the gate, his head was going to split open 
with the pain from his scar — 

The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging 
Hermione with him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, 

“ ConfringoV’ and her spell flew around the room, 
exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back 
at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the 
heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his 
cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from 
bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of 
the smashed window into nothingness, her scream 
reverberating through the night as they twisted in 
midair. ... 

And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort 
and he was running across the fetid bedroom, his 
long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he 

Page | 385 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and 
vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that 
mingled with the girl’s, that echoed across the dark 
gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas 
Day. ... 

And his scream was Harry’s scream, his pain was 
Harry’s pain ... that it could happen here, where it 
had happened before ... here, within sight of that 
house where he had come so close to knowing what it 
was to die ... to die. ... The pain was so terrible ... 
ripped from his body. ... But if he had no body, why 
did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how could 
he feel so unbearably, didn’t pain cease with death, 
didn’t it go ... 

The night wet and windy, two children dressed as 
pumpkins waddling across the square, and the shop 
windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry 
Muggle trappings of a world in which they did not 
believe. ... And he was gliding along, that sense of 
purpose and power and rightness in him that he 
always knew on these occasions. . . . Not anger . . . that 
was for weaker souls than he ... but triumph, yes. ... 
He had waited for this, he had hoped for it. ... 

“Nice costume, mister!” 

He saw the small boy’s smile falter as he ran near 
enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the 
fear cloud his painted face: Then the child turned and 
ran away. ... Beneath the robe he fingered the handle 
of his wand. ... One simple movement and the child 
would never reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, 
quite unnecessary. . . . 

And along a new and darker street he moved, and 
now his destination was in sight at last, the Fidelius 
Charm broken, though they did not know it yet. ... 

Page | 386 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




And he made less noise than the dead leaves 
slithering along the pavement as he drew level with 
the dark hedge, and stared over it. ... 

They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite 
clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black-haired 
man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke 
erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small 
black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was 
laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in 
his small fist. ... 

A door opened and the mother entered, saying words 
he could not hear, her long dark-red hair falling over 
her face. Now the father scooped up the son and 
handed him to the mother. He threw his wand down 
upon the sofa and stretched, yawning. . . . 

The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but 
James Potter did not hear. His white hand pulled out 
the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the 
door, which burst open. 

He was over the threshold as James came sprinting 
into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had not even 
picked up his wand. ... 

“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! Ill hold 
him off!” 

Hold him off, without a wand in his hand! . . . He 
laughed before casting the curse. . . . 

“Avada Kedavra!” 

The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the 
pram pushed against the wall, it made the banisters 
glare like lightning rods, and James Potter fell like a 
marionette whose strings were cut. ... 

Page | 387 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, 
trapped, but as long as she was sensible, she, at 
least, had nothing to fear. ... He climbed the steps, 
listening with faint amusement to her attempts to 
barricade herself in. ... She had no wand upon her 
either. ... How stupid they were, and how trusting, 
thinking that their safety lay in friends, that weapons 
could be discarded even for moments. ... 

He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and 
boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his 
wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. At 
the sight of him, she dropped her son into the crib 
behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would 
help, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be 
chosen instead. . . . 

“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!” 

“Stand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside, now. ” 

“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead — ” 

“This is my last warning — ” 

“Not Harry! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . . 

Not Harry! Not Harry! Please — I’ll do anything — ” 

“Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!” 

He could have forced her away from the crib, but it 
seemed more prudent to finish them all. ... 

The green light flashed around the room and she 
dropped like her husband. The child had not cried all 
this time: He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, 
and he looked up into the intruder’s face with a kind of 
bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father 



Page | 388 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, 
and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing — 

He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy’s face: 
He wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, 
inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: It had seen 
that he was not James. He did not like it crying, he 
had never been able to stomach the small ones 
whining in the orphanage — 

“Avada Kedavra!” 

And then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain 
and terror, and he must hide himself, not here in the 
rubble of the ruined house, where the child was 
trapped and screaming, but far away . . . far away. . . . 

“No,” he moaned. 

The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he 
had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy. . . . 

“No ...” 

And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda’s 
house, immersed in memories of his greatest loss, and 
at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china 
and glass. ... He looked down and saw something ... 
something incredible. . . . 

“No ...” 

“Harry, it’s all right, you’re all right!” 

He stooped down and picked up the smashed 
photograph. There he was, the unknown thief, the 
thief he was seeking. . . . 

“No ... I dropped it. ... I dropped it. ...” 

Page | 389 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry, it’s okay, wake up, wake up!” 



He was Harry. ... Harry, not Voldemort ... and the 
thing that was rustling was not a snake. ... He opened 
his eyes. 

“Harry,” Hermione whispered. “Do you feel all — all 
right?” 

“Yes,” he lied. 

He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks 
beneath a heap of blankets. He could tell that it was 
almost dawn by the stillness and the quality of the 
cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He was 
drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and 
blankets. 

“We got away.” 

“Yes,” said Hermione. “I had to use a Hover Charm to 
get you into your bunk, I couldn’t lift you. You’ve 
been ... Well, you haven’t been quite ...” 

There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and 
he noticed a small sponge in her hand: She had been 
wiping his face. 

“You’ve been ill,” she finished. “Quite ill.” 

“How long ago did we leave?” 

“Hours ago. It’s nearly morning.” 

“And I’ve been ... what, unconscious?” 

“Not exactly,” said Hermione uncomfortably. “You’ve 
been shouting and moaning and ... things,” she 
added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What 

Page | 390 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




had he done? Screamed curses like Voldemort, cried 
like the baby in the crib? 

“I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” Hermione said, 
and he knew she wanted to change the subject. “It 
was stuck, stuck to your chest. You’ve got a mark; I’m 
sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away. 
The snake bit you too, but I’ve cleaned the wound and 
put some dittany on it. ...” 

He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away 
from himself and looked down. There was a scarlet 
oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. 
He could also see the half-healed puncture marks to 
his forearm. 

“Where Ve you put the Horcrux?” 

“In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.” 

He lay back on his pillows and looked into her 
pinched gray face. 

“We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my 
fault, it’s all my fault, Hermione, I’m sorry.” 

“It’s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought 
Dumbledore might have left the sword there for you.” 

“Yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn’t we?” 

“What happened, Harry? What happened when she 
took you upstairs? Was the snake hiding somewhere? 
Did it just come out and kill her and attack you?” 

“No,” he said. “She was the snake ... or the snake was 
her ... all along.” 

“W-what?” 

Page | 391 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s 
house on him: It made the whole thing horribly vivid. 

“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was 
... was inside her. You-Know-Who put it there in 
Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I’d 
go back.” 

“The snake was inside her?” 

He opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted, 
nauseated. 

“Lupin said there would be magic we’d never 
imagined,” Harry said. “She didn’t want to talk in 
front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all 
Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I 
could understand her. Once we were up in the room, 
the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard 
it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he 
said to keep me there ... and then ...” 

He remembered the snake coming our of Bathilda’s 
neck: Hermione did not need to know the details. 

"... she changed, changed into the snake, and 
attacked.” 

He looked down at the puncture marks. 

“It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till 
You-Know-Who came.” 

If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would 
have been worth it, all of it. ... Sick at heart, he sat up 
and threw back the covers. 

“Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!” 



Page | 392 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you 
look terrible. I’m fine. I’ll keep watch for a while. 
Where’s my wand?” 

She did not answer, she merely looked at him. 
“Where’s my wand, Hermione?” 

She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. 
“Harry ...” 

“ Where’s my wand?” 

She reached down beside the bed and held it out to 
him. 

The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in 
two. One fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both 
pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered 
apart completely. Harry took it into his hands as 
though it was a living thing that had suffered a 
terrible injury. He could not think properly: 
Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held 
out the wand to Hermione. 

“Mend it. Please.” 

“Harry, I don’t think, when it’s broken like this — ” 
“Please, Hermione, try!” 

“R-Reparo.” 

The dangling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry 
held it up. 

“Lumosl” 



Page | 393 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry 
pointed it at Hermione. 

“ Expelliarmusl” 

Hermione ’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave 
her hand. The feeble attempt at magic was too much 
for Harry’s wand, which split into two again. He 
stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was 
seeing . . . the wand that had survived so much . . . 

“Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could 
hardly hear her. “I’m so, so sorry. I think it was me. 

As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming 
for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it 
rebounded everywhere, and it must have — must 
have hit — ” 

“It was an accident,” said Harry mechanically. He felt 
empty, stunned. “We’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it.” 

“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said 
Hermione, the tears trickling down her face. 
“Remember . . . remember Ron? When he broke his 
wand, crashing the car? It was never the same again, 
he had to get a new one.” 

Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held 
hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who was dead. 
How was he supposed to find himself a new wand? 

“Well,” he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, “well, 
I’ll just borrow yours for now, then. While I keep 
watch.” 

Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her 
wand, and he left her sitting beside his bed, desiring 
nothing more than to get away from her.

THE LIFE AND LIES OF ALBUS 
DUMBLEDORE 

The sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness 
of the sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and 
his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent entrance and 
took a deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to 
watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside 
ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet 
he could not appreciate it: His senses had been 
spiked by the calamity of losing his wand. He looked 
out over a valley blanketed in snow, distant church 
bells chiming through the glittering silence. 

Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into 
his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain. 

He had spilled his own blood more times than he 
could count; he had lost all the bones in his right arm 
once; this journey had already given him scars to his 
chest and forearm to join those on his hand and 
forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt 
himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and 
naked, as though the best part of his magical power 
had been torn from him. He knew exactly what 
Page | 395 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Hermione would say if he expressed any of this: The 
wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was 
wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the 
wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot 
golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the 
protection of the twin cores, and only now that it was 
gone did he realize how much he had been counting 
upon it. 

He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his 
pocket and, without looking at them, tucked them 
away in Hagrid’s pouch around his neck. The pouch 
was now too full of broken and useless objects to take 
any more. Harry’s hand brushed the old Snitch 
through the mokeskin and for a moment he had to 
fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. 
Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else 
Dumbledore had left behind — 

And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like 
lava, scorching him inside, wiping out every other 
feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked 
themselves into believing that Godric’s Hollow held 
answers, convinced themselves that they were 
supposed to go back, that it was all part of some 
secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore; but 
there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left them 
to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown 
and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: 

Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they 
had no sword, and now, Harry had no wand. And he 
had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would 
surely be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he 
was. ... Voldemort had all the information now. ... 

“Harry?” 

Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her 
with her own wand. Her face streaked with tears, she 

Page | 396 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling 
in her hands and something bulky under her arm. 

“Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups. 

“Do you mind if I talk to you?” 

“No,” he said because he did not want to hurt her 
feelings. 

“Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the 
picture was. Well ... I’ve got the book.” 

Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of 
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. 

“Where — how — ?” 

“It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there. ... 
This note was sticking out of the top of it.” 

Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green 
writing aloud. 

“ ‘Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here’s a copy of 
the book, hope you like it. You said everything, even if 
you don’t remember it. Rita.’ I think it must have 
arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps 
she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?” 

“No, she probably wasn’t.” 

Harry looked down upon Dumbledore ’s face and 
experienced a surge of savage pleasure: Now he would 
know all the things that Dumbledore had never 
thought it worth telling him, whether Dumbledore 
wanted him to or not. 



Page | 397 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said 
Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out 
of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have 
shown in his face. 

“No,” he said quietly. “No, Hermione, I know it was an 
accident. You were trying to get us out of there alive, 
and you were incredible. I’d be dead if you hadn’t 
been there to help me.” 

He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his 
attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it had clearly 
never been opened before. He riffled through the 
pages, looking for photographs. He came across the 
one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore 
and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter 
at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to 
the caption. 

Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother’s death, 
with his friend Gellert Grindelwald. 

Harry gaped at the last word for several long 
moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. He 
looked sideways at Hermione, who was still 
contemplating the name as though she could not 
believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. 

“ Grindelwald?” 

Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry 
searched the pages around them for a recurrence of 
that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read 
greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go 
further back to make sense of it all, and eventually he 
found himself at the start of a chapter entitled “The 
Greater Good.” Together, he and Hermione started to 
read: 



Page | 398 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, 

Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory — Head 
Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for 
Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth 
Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal- 
Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the 
International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. 
Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour 
with Elphias “Dogbreath” Doge, the dim-witted but 
devoted sidekick he had picked up at school. 

The two young men were staying at the Leaky 
Cauldron in London, preparing to depart for Greece the 
following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news 
of Dumbledore’ s mother’s death. “Dogbreath” Doge, 
who refused to be interviewed for this book, has given 
the public his own sentimental version of what 
happened next. He represents Kendra’s death as a 
tragic blow, and Dumbledore’s decision to give up his 
expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice. 

Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric’s Hollow at 
once, supposedly to “care” for his younger brother 
and sister. But how much care did he actually give 
them? 

“He were a head case, that Aberforth,” says Enid 
Smeek, whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric’s 
Hollow at that time. “Ran wild. ’Course, with his mum 
and dad gone you’d have felt sorry for him, only he 
kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don’t think 
Albus was fussed about him, I never saw them 
together, anyway.” 

So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild 
young brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the 
continued imprisonment of his sister. For, though her 
first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful 
condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very existence 
Page | 399 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




continued to be known only to those few outsiders 
who, like “Dogbreath” Doge, could be counted upon to 
believe in the story of her “ill health.” 

Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was 
Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated magical historian 
who has lived in Godric’s Hollow for many years. 
Kendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she 
first attempted to welcome the family to the village. 
Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to 
Albus at Hog warts, having been favorably impressed 
by his paper on trans-species transformation in 
Transfiguration Today. This initial contact led to 
acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family . At 
the time of Kendra’s death, Bathilda was the only 
person in Godric’s Hollow who was on speaking terms 
with Dumbledore’s mother. 

Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited 
earlier in her life has now dimmed. “The fire’s lit, but 
the cauldron’s empty,” as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, 
or, in Enid Smeek’s slightly earthier phrase, “She’s 
nutty as squirrel poo.” Nevertheless, a combination of 
tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to 
extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together 
the whole scandalous story. 

Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts 
Kendra’s premature death down to a backfiring 
charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in 
later years. Bathilda also parrots the family line on 
Ariana, calling her “frail” and “delicate.” On one 
subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I 
put into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she 
alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of 
Albus Dumbledore’s life. Now revealed for the first 
time, it calls into question everything that his 
admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed 
hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the 
Page | 400 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own 
family. 

The very same summer that Dumbledore went home 
to Godric’s Hollow, now an orphan and head of the 
family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her 
home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. 

The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of 
Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would 
miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who 
arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As 
Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to 
Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are 
not widely known here. 

Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then 
for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, 
Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously 
brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than channel his 
abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, 
however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other 
pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it 
could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted 
experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was 
expelled. 

Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald ’s 
next movements is that he “traveled abroad for some 
months.” It can now be revealed that Grindelwald 
chose to visit his great-aunt in Godric’s Hollow, and 
that there, intensely shocking though it will be for 
many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with 
none other than Albus Dumbledore. 

“He seemed a charming boy to me,” babbles Bathilda, 
“whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him 
to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads 
his own age. The boys took to each other at once.” 

Page | 401 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept 
by her, that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert 
Grindelwald in the dead of night. 

“Yes, even after they’d spent all day in discussion — 
both such brilliant young boys, they got on like a 
cauldron on fire — I’d sometimes hear an owl tapping 
at Gellert’s bedroom window, delivering a letter from 
Albus! An idea would have struck him, and he had to 
let Gellert know immediately!” 

And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking 
though Albus Dumbledore’ s fans will find it, here are 
the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as 
relayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the original 
letter may be seen on page 463.) 

Gellert — 

Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE 
MUGGLES’ OWN GOOD — this, I think , is the crucial 
point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that 
power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us 
responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this 
point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we 
build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this 
must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We 
seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this 
it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use 
only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was 
your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, 
because if you had not been expelled, we would never 
have met.) 

Albus 

Astonished and appalled though his many admirers 
will be, this letter constitutes proof that Albus 
Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute 

Page | 402 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. 
What a blow for those who have always portrayed 
Dumbledore as the Muggle-boms’ greatest champion! 
How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle rights 
seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How 
despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy 
plotting his rise to power when he should have been 
mourning his mother and caring for his sister! 

No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on 
his crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after 
all, put his plans into action, that he must have 
suffered a change of heart, that he came to his 
senses. However, the truth seems altogether more 
shocking. 

Barely two months into their great new friendship, 
Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each 
other again until they met for their legendary duel (for 
more, see chapter 22). What caused this abrupt 
rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had he 
told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? 
Alas, no. 

“It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,” 
says Bathilda. “It came as an awful shock. Gellert was 
there in the house when it happened, and he came 
back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to 
go home the next day. Terribly distressed, you know. 
So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of 
him. 

“Albus was beside himself at Ariana’s death. It was so 
dreadful for those two brothers. They had lost 
everybody except each other. No wonder tempers ran 
a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as 
people will under these dreadful circumstances. But 
Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All 
the same, breaking Albus’s nose at the funeral was 
Page | 403 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her 
sons fighting like that, across her daughter’s body. A 
shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. 

... He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least. 



This dreadful coffin- side brawl, known only to those 
few who attended Ariana Dumbledore’s funeral, raises 
several questions. Why exactly did Aberforth 
Dumbledore blame Albus for his sister’s death? Was 
it, as “Batty” pretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or 
could there have been some more concrete reason for 
his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for 
near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the 
country hours after the girl’s death, and Albus (out of 
shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced 
to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. 

Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to 
have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later 
life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore 
delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and 
disappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald. 
Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of 
exposure as his once best friend that caused 
Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that 
Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once 
so delighted he had met? 

And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the 
inadvertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble 
across something she ought not to have done, as the 
two young men sat practicing for their attempt at 
glory and domination? Is it possible that Ariana 
Dumbledore was the first person to die “for the 
greater good”? 



Page | 404 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. 
Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before 
him. She tugged the book out of Harry’s hands, 
looking a little alarmed by his expression, and closed 
it without looking at it, as though hiding something 
indecent. 

“Harry — ” 

But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had 
crashed down inside him; it was exactly as he had felt 
after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, believed 
him the embodiment of goodness and wisdom. All was 
ashes: How much more could he lose? Ron, 
Dumbledore, the phoenix wand ... 

“Harry.” She seemed to have heard his thoughts. 
“Listen to me. It — it doesn’t make very nice reading 



“Yeah, you could say that — ” 

“ — but don’t forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter 
writing.” 

“You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn’t you?” 

“Yes, I — I did.” She hesitated, looking upset, cradling 
her tea in her cold hands. “I think that’s the worst bit. 
I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but ‘For 
the Greater Good’ became Grindelwald ’s slogan, his 
justification for all the atrocities he committed later. 
And . . . from that ... it looks like Dumbledore gave him 
the idea. They say ‘For the Greater Good’ was even 
carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.” 

“What’s Nurmengard?” 



Page | 405 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his 
opponents. He ended up in there himself, once 
Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it’s — it’s an 
awful thought that Dumbledore ’s ideas helped 
Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, 
even Rita can’t pretend that they knew each other for 
more than a few months one summer when they were 
both really young, and — ” 

“I thought you’d say that,” said Harry. He did not 
want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was hard 
to keep his voice steady. “I thought you’d say They 
were young. ’ They were the same age as we are now. 
And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark 
Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best 
friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.” 

His temper would not remain in check much longer: 
He stood up and walked around, trying to work some 
of it off. 

“I’m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,” 
said Hermione. “All that ‘right to rule’ rubbish, it’s 
‘Magic Is Might’ all over again. But Harry, his mother 
had just died, he was stuck alone in the house — ” 

“Alone? He wasn’t alone! He had his brother and 
sister for company, his Squib sister he was keeping 
locked up — ” 

“I don’t believe it,” said Hermione. She stood up too. 
“Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she 
was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, 
ever have allowed — ” 

“The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to 
conquer Muggles by force!” Harry shouted, his voice 
echoing across the empty hilltop, and several 



Page | 406 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




blackbirds rose into the air, squawking and spiraling 
against the pearly sky. 

“He changed, Harry, he changed! It’s as simple as 
that! Maybe he did believe these things when he was 
seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was 
devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was 
the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always 
voted for Muggle protection and Muggle-born rights, 
who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who 
died trying to bring him down!” 

Rita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that 
the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at 
both. 

“Harry, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so 
angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this 
himself.” 

“Maybe I am!” Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms 
over his head, hardly knowing whether he was trying 
to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight 
of his own disillusionment. “Look what he asked from 
me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And 
again! And don’t expect me to explain everything, just 
trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, 
trust me even though I don’t trust you! Never the 
whole truth! Never!” 

His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood 
looking at each other in the whiteness and the 
emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant 
as insects beneath that wide sky. 

“He loved you,” Hermione whispered. “I know he loved 
you.” 



Harry dropped his arms. 

Page | 407 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was 
never me. This isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He 
shared a damn sight more of what he was really 
thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared 
with me.” 

Harry picked up Hermione ’s wand, which he had 
dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the 
entrance of the tent. 

“Thanks for the tea. I’ll finish the watch. You get back 
in the warm.” 

She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She 
picked up the book and then walked back past him 
into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top 
of his head lightly with her hand. He closed his eyes 
at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what 
she said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared.

THE SILVER DOE 

It was snowing by the time Hermione took over the 
watch at midnight. Harry’s dreams were confused and 
disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, first 
through a gigantic, cracked ring, then through a 
wreath of Christmas roses. He woke repeatedly, 
panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to 
him in the distance, imagining that the wind 
whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices. 

Finally he got up in the darkness and joined 
Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the 
tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her 
wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she 
greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early 
and moving on. 

“Well go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, 
shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her 
pajamas. “I kept thinking I could hear people moving 
outside. I even thought I saw somebody once or 
twice.” 



Page | 409 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and 
glanced at the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the 
table. 

“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking 
nervous. “The snow in the dark, it plays tricks on 
your eyes. ... But perhaps we ought to Disapparate 
under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?” 

Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry 
wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching the 
beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness 
engulfed them; Harry’s feet parted company with the 
snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like 
frozen earth covered with leaves. 

“Where are we?” he asked, peering around at a fresh 
mass of trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag 
and began tugging out tent poles. 

“The Forest of Dean,” she said. “I came camping here 
once with my mum and dad.” 

Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was 
bitterly cold, but they were at least protected from the 
wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, 
huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue 
flames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and 
which could be scooped up and carried around in a 
jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from 
some brief but severe illness, an impression 
reinforced by Hermione ’s solicitousness. That 
afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so 
that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting 
of powdery snow. 

After two nights of little sleep, Harry’s senses seemed 
more alert than usual. Their escape from Godric’s 
Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed 

Page | 410 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




somehow closer than before, more threatening. As 
darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s 
offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed. 

Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and 
sat down, wearing all the sweaters he owned but even 
so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the 
passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. He 
was on the point of taking out the Marauder’s Map, so 
as to watch Ginny’s dot for a while, before he 
remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and 
that she would be back at the Burrow. 

Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the 
vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must be full 
of living creatures, but he wished they would all 
remain still and silent so that he could separate their 
innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that 
might proclaim other, sinister movements. He 
remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead 
leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard 
it again before mentally shaking himself. Their 
protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why 
should they break now? And yet he could not throw 
off the feeling that something was different tonight. 

Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching 
because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward 
angle against the side of the tent. The night reached 
such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have 
been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and 
Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his 
face to see whether he could make out his fingers 
when it happened. 

A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, 
moving through the trees. Whatever the source, it was 
moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift 
toward him. 

Page | 411 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, 
and raised Hermione’s wand. He screwed up his eyes 
as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it 
pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing came 
closer. ... 

And then the source of the light stepped out from 
behind an oak. It was a silver- white doe, moon-bright 
and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still 
silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering 
of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head 
with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high. 

Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not 
at her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. 
He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but 
that he had forgotten, until this moment, that they 
had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for 
Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, 
had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on 
it, that she had come for him, and him alone. 

They gazed at each other for several long moments 
and then she turned and walked away. 

“No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of 
use. “Come back!” 

She continued to step deliberately through the trees, 
and soon her brightness was striped by their thick 
black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. 
Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. 
But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this 
was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit. 

Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no 
noise as she passed through the trees, for she was 
nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest 
she led him, and Harry walked quickly, sure that 

Page | 412 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




when she stopped, she would allow him to approach 
her properly. And then she would speak and the voice 
would tell him what he needed to know. 

At last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful 
head toward him once more, and he broke into a run, 
a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips 
to ask it, she vanished. 

Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her 
burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas; it 
obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his 
eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear came: Her 
presence had meant safety. 

“Lumos\” he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited. 

The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of 
his eyes as he stood there, listening to the sounds of 
the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of 
snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed 
him into an ambush? Was he imagining that 
somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, 
watching him? 

He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no 
flash of green light burst from behind a tree. Why, 
then, had she led him to this spot? 

Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and 
Harry spun about, but all that was there was a small, 
frozen pool, its cracked black surface glittering as he 
raised the wand higher to examine it. 

He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. 
The ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam 
of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray 
carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross 

Page | 413 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his 
knees at the pool’s edge and angled the wand so as to 
flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as 
possible. A glint of deep red ... It was a sword with 
glittering rubies in its hilt. ... The sword of Gryffindor 
was lying at the bottom of the forest pool. 

Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this 
possible? How could it have come to be lying in a 
forest pool, this close to the place where they were 
camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione 
to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be 
a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or 
had the sword been put into the pool after they had 
arrived, precisely because they were here? In which 
case, where was the person who had wanted to pass 
it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the 
surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a 
human outline, for the glint of an eye, but he could 
not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear 
leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention 
to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen 
pool. 

He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and 
murmured, “Accio Sword.” 

It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been 
that easy, the sword would have lain on the ground 
for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. 
He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard 
about the last time the sword had delivered itself to 
him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had 
asked for help. 

“Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon 
the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless. 



Page | 414 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), 
that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had 
retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have 
pulled that out of the hat. And what were the qualities 
that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry’s 
head answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry 
set Gryffindors apart. 

Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his 
smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. 
He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with 
himself, he had thought it might come to this from 
the moment he had spotted the sword through the 
ice. 

He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, 
but was convinced now that nobody was going to 
attack him. They had had their chance as he walked 
alone through the forest, had had plenty of 
opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason 
to delay at this point was because the immediate 
prospect was so deeply uninviting. 

With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his 
many layers of clothing. Where “chivalry” entered into 
this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, 
unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not 
calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. 

An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he 
thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering 
now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he 
continued to strip off until at last he stood there in 
his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the 
pouch containing his wand, his mother’s letter, the 
shard of Sirius’s mirror, and the old Snitch on top of 
his clothes, then he pointed Hermione’s wand at the 
ice. 



Page | 415 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Diffindo.” 



It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: 

The surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice 
rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could 
judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword he 
would have to submerge himself completely. 

Contemplating the task ahead would not make it 
easier or the water warmer. He stepped to the pool’s 
edge and placed Hermione’s wand on the ground, still 
lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much colder he 
was about to become or how violently he would soon 
be shivering, he jumped. 

Every pore of his body screamed in protest: The very 
air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was 
submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He 
could hardly breathe; trembling so violently the water 
lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade 
with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once. 

Harry put off the moment of total submersion from 
second to second, gasping and shaking, until he told 
himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, 
and dived. 

The cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His 
brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed 
through the dark water to the bottom and reached 
out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed around 
the hilt; he pulled it upward. 

Then something closed tight around his neck. He 
thought of water weeds, though nothing had brushed 
him as he dived, and raised his empty hand to free 
himself. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux 
had tightened and was slowly constricting his 
windpipe. 

Page | 416 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back 
to the surface, but merely propelled himself into the 
rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he 
scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen fingers 
unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping 
inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was 
nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that 
closed around his chest were surely Death’s. ... 

Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he 
had ever been in his life, he came to facedown in the 
snow. Somewhere close by, another person was 
panting and coughing and staggering around. 
Hermione had come again, as she had come when the 
snake attacked. ... Yet it did not sound like her, not 
with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of 
the footsteps. ... 

Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his 
savior’s identity. All he could do was raise a shaking 
hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket 
had cut tightly into his flesh. It was gone: Someone 
had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from 
over his head. 

“Are — you — mental?” 

Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could 
have given Harry the strength to get up. Shivering 
violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him 
stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched to the skin, his 
hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in 
one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken 
chain in the other. 

“Why the hell,” panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, 
which swung backward and forward on its shortened 
chain in some parody of hypnosis, “didn’t you take 
this thing off before you dived?” 

Page | 417 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, 
nothing compared with Ron’s reappearance; he could 
not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the 
pile of clothes still lying at the water’s edge and began 
to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater 
over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him 
to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, 
and yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the 
pool, he had saved Harry’s life. 

“It was y-you?” Harry said at last, his teeth 
chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his 
near-strangulation. 

“Well, yeah,” said Ron, looking slightly confused. 
“Y-you cast that doe?” 

“What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing 
it!” 



“My Patronus is a stag.” 

“Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.” 

Harry put Hagrid’s pouch back around his neck, 
pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up 
Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron again. 

“How come you’re here?” 

Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come 
up later, if at all. 

“Well, I’ve — you know — I’ve come back. If — ” He 
cleared his throat. “You know. You still want me.” 

There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron’s 
departure seemed to rise like a wall between them. 

Page | 418 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved 
Harry’s life. 

Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed 
momentarily surprised to see the things he was 
holding. 

“Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, 
holding up the sword for Harry’s inspection. “That’s 
why you jumped in, right?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I don’t understand. How did 
you get here? How did you find us?” 

“Long story,” said Ron. “I’ve been looking for you for 
hours, it’s a big forest, isn’t it? And I was just 
thinking I’d have to kip under a tree and wait for 
morning when I saw that deer coming and you 
following.” 

“You didn’t see anyone else?” 

“No,” said Ron. “I — ” 

But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close 
together some yards away. 

“I did think I saw something move over there, but I 
was running to the pool at the time, because you’d 
gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t going to 
make a detour to — hey!” 

Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had 
indicated. The two oaks grew close together; there 
was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at 
eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen. The 
ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, 
and Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked 



Page | 419 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the 
sword and the Horcrux. 



“Anything there?” Ron asked. 

“No,” said Harry. 

“So how did the sword get in that pool?” 

“Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.” 

They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied 
hilt glinting a little in the light from Hermione’s wand. 

“You reckon this is the real one?” asked Ron. 

“One way to find out, isn’t there?” said Harry. 

The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron’s hand. The 
locket was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the 
thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the 
presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry 
rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time 
for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy 
the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, 
holding Hermione’s wand high, and saw the place: a 
flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree. 

“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed 
snow from the rock’s surface, and held out his hand 
for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, 
however, Harry shook his head. 

“No, you should do it.” 

“Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?” 

“Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s 
supposed to be you.” 

Page | 420 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he 
had known that the doe was benign, he knew that 
Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. 

Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something 
about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable 
power of certain acts. 

“I’m going to open it,” said Harry, “and you stab it. 
Straightaway, okay? Because whatever’s in there will 
put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the diary tried to 
kill me.” 

“How are you going to open it?” asked Ron. He looked 
terrified. 

“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said 
Harry. The answer came so readily to his lips that he 
thought that he had always known it deep down: 
Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini 
to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, 
inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to 
visualize it as a minuscule snake, curled upon the 
cold rock. 

“No!” said Ron. “No, don’t open it! I’m serious!” 

“Why not?” asked Harry. “Let’s get rid of the damn 
thing, it’s been months — ” 

“I can’t, Harry, I’m serious — you do it — ” 

“But why?” 

“Because that thing’s bad for me!” said Ron, backing 
away from the locket on the rock. “I can’t handle it! 

I’m not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, 
but it affects me worse than it affected you and 
Hermione, it made me think stuff — stuff I was 
thinking anyway, but it made everything worse, I 
Page | 421 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




can’t explain it, and then I’d take it off and I’d get my 
head on straight again, and then I’d have to put the 
effing thing back on — I can’t do it, Harry!” 

He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, 
shaking his head. 

“You can do it,” said Harry, “you can! You’ve just got 
the sword, I know it’s supposed to be you who uses it. 
Please, just get rid of it, Ron.” 

The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. 
Ron swallowed, then, still breathing hard through his 
long nose, moved back toward the rock. 

“Tell me when,” he croaked. 

“On three,” said Harry, looking back down at the 
locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating on the 
letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the 
locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have 
been easy to pity it, except that the cut around 
Harry’s neck still burned. 

“One ... two ... three ... open.” 

The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the 
golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little 
click. 

Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a 
living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes 
had been before he turned them scarlet and slit- 
pupiled. 

“Stab,” said Harry, holding the locket steady on the 
rock. 



Page | 422 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point 
dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry 
gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already 
imagining blood pouring from the empty windows. 

Then a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux. 

“I have seen your heart, and it is mine.” 

“Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly. “Stab it!” 

“I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have 
seen your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that 
you dread is also possible. ...” 

“Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the 
surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron 
gazed down into Riddle’s eyes. 

“ Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a 
daughter . . . Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers 
your friend . . . Second best, always, eternally 
overshadowed ...” 

“Ron, stab it now!” Harry bellowed: He could feel the 
locket quivering in his grip and was scared of what 
was coming. Ron raised the sword still higher, and as 
he did so, Riddle’s eyes gleamed scarlet. 

Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there 
bloomed, like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of 
Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted. 

Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures 
blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists, 
then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side 
like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron and 
the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away 
from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot.

“Ron!” he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now 
speaking with Voldemort’s voice and Ron was gazing, 
mesmerized, into its face. 

“ Why return? We were better without you, happier 
without you, glad of your absence. . . . We laughed at 
your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption — ” 

“ Presumption?’ echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was 
more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real 
Hermione: She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who 
looked horrified yet transfixed, the sword hanging 
pointlessly at his side. “ Who could look at you, who 
would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What 
have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? 
What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?” 

“Ron, stab it, STAB IT!” Harry yelled, but Ron did not 
move: His eyes were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and 
the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair 
swirling like flames, their eyes shining red, their 
voices lifted in an evil duet. 

“ Your mother confessed,” sneered Riddle-Harry, while 
Riddle-Hermione jeered, “that she would have 
preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange ...” 

“Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take 
you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned 
Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and 
entwined herself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him 
in a close embrace: Their lips met. 

On the ground in front of them, Ron’s face filled with 
anguish. He raised the sword high, his arms shaking. 

“Do it, Ron!” Harry yelled. 



Page | 424 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a 
trace of scarlet in his eyes. 

“Ron — ?” 

The sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out 
of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long, 
drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in 
the snow, wand held ready to defend himself: but 
there was nothing to fight. 

The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione 
were gone: There was only Ron, standing there with 
the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at 
the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock. 

Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing 
what to say or do. Ron was breathing heavily: His 
eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue; 
they were also wet. 

Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and 
picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced the 
glass in both windows: Riddle’s eyes were gone, and 
the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking 
slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had 
vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act. 

The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to 
his knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but 
not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the 
broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, 
and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He 
took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off. 

“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the 
fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. 
Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There 



Page | 425 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




were loads of nights when we never even spoke to 
each other. With you gone ...” 

He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was 
here again that Harry fully realized how much his 
absence had cost them. 

“She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a 
sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. 
It’s always been like that. I thought you knew.” 

Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from 
Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry 
got to his feet again and walked to where Ron’s 
enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron 
had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. 
He hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to 
Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, 
eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed. 

“I’m sorry,” he said in a thick voice. “I’m sorry I left. I 
know I was a — a — ” 

He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad 
enough word would swoop down upon him and claim 
him. 

“You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry. 
“Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving 
my life.” 

“That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron 
mumbled. 

“Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really 
was,” said Harry. “I’ve been trying to tell you that for 
years.” 



Page | 426 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, 
Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron’s jacket. 

“And now,” said Harry as they broke apart, “all we’ve 
got to do is find the tent again.” 

But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the 
dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with 
Ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a 
surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake 
Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that 
he entered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him. 

It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, 
the only illumination the bluebell flames still 
shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast 
asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not 
move until Harry had said her name several times. 

“Hermionel” 

She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out 
of her face. 

“What’s wrong? Harry? Are you all right?” 

“It’s okay, everything’s fine. More than fine. I’m great. 
There’s someone here.” 

“What do you mean? Who — ?” 

She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and 
dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry backed 
into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron’s rucksack, 
and attempted to blend in with the canvas. 

Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a 
sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. 
She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly 

Page | 427 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak, hopeful smile 
and half raised his arms. 

Hermione launched herself forward and started 
punching every inch of him that she could reach. 

“Ouch — ow — gerroff! What the — ? Hermione — 
OW!” 

“You — complete — arse — Ronald — Weasley!” 

She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed 
away, shielding his head as Hermione advanced. 

“You — crawl — back — here — after — weeks — and 
— weeks — oh, where’s my wand?” 

She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of 
Harry’s hands and he reacted instinctively. 

“Protegol” 

The invisible shield erupted between Ron and 
Hermione: The force of it knocked her backward onto 
the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she leapt up 
again. 

“Hermione!” said Harry. “Calm — ” 

“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before 
had he seen her lose control like this; she looked 
quite demented. “Give me back my wand! Give it back 
to me\” 

“Hermione, will you please — ” 

“Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!” she 
screeched. “Don’t you dare! Give it back now! And 
YOU!” 

Page | 428 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was 
like a malediction, and Harry could not blame Ron for 
retreating several steps. 

“I came running after you! I called you! I begged you 
to come back!” 

“I know,” Ron said, “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really — 



“Oh, you’re sorry!” 

She laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; 
Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry merely 
grimaced his helplessness. 

“You come back after weeks — weeks — and you 
think it’s all going to be all right if you just say 
sorry?” 

“Well, what else can I say?” Ron shouted, and Harry 
was glad that Ron was fighting back. 

“Oh, I don’t know!” yelled Hermione with awful 
sarcasm. “Rack your brains, Ron, that should only 
take a couple of seconds — ” 

“Hermione,” interjected Harry, who considered this a 
low blow, “he just saved my — ” 

“I don’t care!” she screamed. “I don’t care what he’s 
done! Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for 
all he knew — ” 

“I knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed Ron, drowning 
her voice for the first time, and approaching as close 
as he could with the Shield Charm between them. 
“Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re 
looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and 
Page | 429 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were 
dead, you don’t know what it’s been like — ” 



“What it’s been like for you?” 

Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to 
hear it soon, but she had reached a level of 
indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, 
and Ron seized his opportunity. 

“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, 
but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, 
Hermione, and I couldn’t go anywhere!” 

“A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione threw 
herself down into a chair with her arms and legs 
crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would 
unravel them for several years. 

“Snatchers,” said Ron. “They’re everywhere — gangs 
trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggle-borns and 
blood traitors, there’s a reward from the Ministry for 
everyone captured. I was on my own and I look like I 
might be school age; they got really excited, thought I 
was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get 
out of being dragged to the Ministry.” 

“What did you say to them?” 

“Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could 
think of.” 

“And they believed that?” 

“They weren’t the brightest. One of them was 
definitely part troll, the smell off him. ...” 

Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might 
soften at this small instance of humor, but her 

Page | 430 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




expression remained stony above her tightly knotted 
limbs. 

“Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or 
not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were 
still five of them and only one of me and they’d taken 
my wand. Then two of them got into a fight and while 
the others were distracted I managed to hit the one 
holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, 
Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. 

I didn’t do it so well, Splinched myself again” — Ron 
held up his right hand to show two missing 
fingernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly — 
“and I came out miles from where you were. By the 
time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we’d 
been ... you’d gone.” 

“Gosh, what a gripping story,” Hermione said in the 
lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound. “You 
must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went 
to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think, what happened 
there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know- Who’s snake turned 
up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know- 
Who himself arrived and missed us by about a 
second.” 

“What?” Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but 
Hermione ignored him. 

“Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts 
our sufferings into perspective, doesn’t it?” 

“Hermione,” said Harry quietly, “Ron just saved my 
life.” 

She appeared not to have heard him. 

“One thing I would like to know, though,” she said, 
fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron’s head. “How 

Page | 431 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




exactly did you find us tonight? That’s important. 

Once we know, we’ll be able to make sure we’re not 
visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.” 

Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object 
from his jeans pocket. 

“This.” 

She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing 
them. 

“The Deluminator?” she asked, so surprised she 
forgot to look cold and fierce. 

“It doesn’t just turn the lights on and off,” said Ron. “I 
don’t know how it works or why it happened then and 
not any other time, because I’ve been wanting to come 
back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio 
really early on Christmas morning and I heard ... I 
heard you.” 

He was looking at Hermione. 

“You heard me on the radio?” she asked 
incredulously. 

“No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your 
voice,” he held up the Deluminator again, “came out 
of this.” 

“And what exactly did I say?” asked Hermione, her 
tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity. 

“My name. ‘Ron.’ And you said ... something about a 
wand. ...” 

Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry 
remembered: It had been the first time Ron’s name 

Page | 432 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




had been said aloud by either of them since the day 
he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when talking 
about repairing Harry’s wand. 

“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the 
Deluminator, “and it didn’t seem different or 
anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So I clicked it. 
And the light went out in my room, but another light 
appeared right outside the window.” 

Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of 
him, his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor 
Hermione could see. 

“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like 
that light you get around a Portkey, you know?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together 
automatically. 

“I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and 
packed it, then I put on my rucksack and went out 
into the garden. 

“The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for 
me, and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I 
followed it behind the shed and then it ... well, it went 
inside me.” 

“Sorry?” said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly. 

“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating 
the movement with his free index finger, “right to my 
chest, and then — it just went straight through. It 
was here,” he touched a point close to his heart, “I 
could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I 
knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take 
me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came 



Page | 433 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere. 



“We were there,” said Harry. “We spent two nights 
there, and the second night I kept thinking I could 
hear someone moving around in the dark and calling 
out!” 

“Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron. “Your 
protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see 
you and I couldn’t hear you. I was sure you were 
around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag 
and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d 
have to show yourselves when you packed up the 
tent.” 

“No, actually,” said Hermione. “We’ve been 
Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra 
precaution. And we left really early, because, as Harry 
says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.” 

“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept 
hoping you’d appear. But when it started to get dark I 
knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the 
Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went 
inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in 
these woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to 
hope one of you would show yourselves in the end — 
and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.” 

“You saw the what?” said Hermione sharply. 

They explained what had happened, and as the story 
of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, 
Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, 
concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs 
locked together. 



Page | 434 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But it must have been a Patronus!” she said. 
“Couldn’t you see who was casting it? Didn’t you see 
anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can’t believe 
this! Then what happened?” 

Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into 
the pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he 
had realized that something was wrong, dived in, and 
saved Harry, then returned for the sword. He got as 
far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and 
Harry cut in. 

“ — and Ron stabbed it with the sword.” 

“And ... and it went? Just like that?” she whispered. 

“Well, it — it screamed,” said Harry with half a glance 
at Ron. “Here.” 

He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it 
up and examined its punctured windows. 

Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry 
removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione’s 
wand and turned to Ron. 

“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers 
with a spare wand?” 

“What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione 
examining the locket. “Oh — oh yeah.” 

He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled 
a short, dark wand out of its pocket. “Here. I figured 
it’s always handy to have a backup.” 

“You were right,” said Harry, holding out his hand. 
“Mine’s broken.” 



Page | 435 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment 
Hermione got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive 
again. 

Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the 
beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and 
settled down without another word. 

Ron passed Harry the new wand. 

“About the best you could hope for, I think,” 
murmured Harry. 

“Yeah,” said Ron. “Could’ve been worse. Remember 
those birds she set on me?” 

“I still haven’t ruled it out,” came Hermione’s muffled 
voice from beneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron 
smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out 
of his rucksack. 



Page | 436 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 





XEN OPHILIUS LOVEGOOD 

Harry had not expected Hermione’s anger to abate 
overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that she 
communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed 
silences the next morning. Ron responded by 
maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her 
presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse. 

In fact, when all three of them were together Harry 
felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended 
funeral. During those few moments he spent alone 
with Harry, however (collecting water and searching 
the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became 
shamelessly cheery. 

“Someone helped us,” he kept saying. “Someone sent 
that doe. Someone’s on our side. One Horcrux down, 
mate!” 

Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to 
debating the possible locations of the other 
Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the 
matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain 
that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. 

Page | 437 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Hermione’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant 
spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the 
appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of 
Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, Ron’s return, made 
Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain 
a straight face. 

Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione’s 
baleful presence again, and under the pretense of 
scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent 
blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange 
of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the 
whole story of his and Hermione’s various 
wanderings, right up to the full story of what had 
happened at Godric’s Hollow; Ron was now filling 
Harry in on everything he had discovered about the 
wider Wizarding world during his weeks away. 

"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he 
asked Harry after explaining the many desperate 
attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry. 

“The what?” 

“You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know- 
Who’s name!” 

“Oh, yeah. Well, it’s just a bad habit we’ve slipped 
into,” said Harry. “But I haven’t got a problem calling 
him V — ” 

“NO!” roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the 
hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book at the 
tent entrance) to scowl over at them. “Sorry,” said 
Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, “but 
the name’s been jinxed, Harry, that’s how they track 
people! Using his name breaks protective 
enchantments, it causes some kind of magical 



Page | 438 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




disturbance — it’s how they found us in Tottenham 
Court Road!” 



“Because we used his name?” 

“Exactly! You’ve got to give them credit, it makes 
sense. It was only people who were serious about 
standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who ever dared 
use it. Now they’ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who 
says it is trackable — quick-and-easy way to find 
Order members! They nearly got Kingsley — ” 

“You’re kidding?” 

“Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill 
said, but he fought his way out. He’s on the run now, 
just like us.” Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with 
the end of his wand. “You don’t reckon Kingsley could 
have sent that doe?” 

“His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, 
remember?” 

“Oh yeah ...” 

They moved farther along the hedge, away from the 
tent and Hermione. 

“Harry ... you don’t reckon it could’ve been 
Dumbledore?” 

“Dumbledore what?” 

Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low 
voice, “Dumbledore ... the doe? I mean,” Ron was 
watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, “he had 
the real sword last, didn’t he?” 



Page | 439 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood 
too well the longing behind the question. The idea 
that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, 
that he was watching over them, would have been 
inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head. 

“Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw 
the body. He’s definitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus 
was a phoenix, not a doe.” 

“Patronuses can change, though, can’t they?” said 
Ron. “Tonks’s changed, didn’t it?” 

“Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he 
show himself? Why wouldn’t he just hand us the 
sword?” 

“Search me,” said Ron. “Same reason he didn’t give it 
to you while he was alive? Same reason he left you an 
old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids’ stories?” 

“Which is what?” asked Harry, turning to look Ron 
full in the face, desperate for the answer. 

“I dunno,” said Ron. “Sometimes I’ve thought, when 
I’ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or — 
or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don’t 
think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing 
when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He — 
well,” Ron’s ears turned bright red and he became 
engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he 
prodded with his toe, “he must’ve known I’d run out 
on you.” 

“No,” Harry corrected him. “He must’ve known you’d 
always want to come back.” 

Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to 
change the subject, Harry said, “Speaking of 

Page | 440 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote 
about him?” 

“Oh yeah,” said Ron at once, “people are talking about 
it quite a lot. ’Course, if things were different, it’d be 
huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, 
but now it’s just something to laugh about for people 
who didn’t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the 
face for everyone who thought he was such a good 
bloke. I don’t know that it’s such a big deal, though. 
He was really young when they — ” 

“Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to 
Hermione, and something in his face seemed to 
decide Ron against pursuing the subject. 

A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the 
brambles. Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had 
given him the previous night, which Hermione had 
since condescended to examine, and had decided was 
made of blackthorn. 

“Engorgio.” 

The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the 
web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew 
slightly larger. 

“Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said 
Dumbledore was young, okay?” 

Harry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders. 

“Sorry — Reducio.” 

The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the 
blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with 
it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those 
he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one 

Page | 441 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else’s 
hand sewn to the end of his arm. 

“You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had 
approached them noiselessly from behind and had 
stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge 
and reduce the spider. “It’s all a matter of confidence, 
Harry.” 

He knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still 
felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the 
retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the 
blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, 
and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to 
be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron 
gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and 
vanished behind her book once more. 

All three of them returned to the tent when darkness 
fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the 
entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand 
levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still 
seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done 
before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, 
while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had 
taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack 
and started to try and tune it. 

“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low 
voice, “that tells the news like it really is. All the 
others are on You- Know- Who’s side and are following 
the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you 
hear it, it’s great. Only they can’t do it every night, 
they have to keep changing locations in case they’re 
raided, and you need a password to tune in. ... 

Trouble is, I missed the last one. ...” 

He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his 
wand, muttering random words under his breath. He 

Page | 442 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing 
an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of 
him he might not have been there. For ten minutes or 
so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the 
pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice 
with the blackthorn wand. 

Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron 
ceased his tapping at once. 

“If it’s annoying you, 111 stop!” he told Hermione 
nervously. 

Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached 
Harry. 

“We need to talk,” she said. 

He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It 
was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. 

“What?” he said apprehensively. It flew through his 
mind that there was a chapter on him in there; he 
was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita’s version of his 
relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione ’s answer, 
however, was completely unexpected. 

“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.” 

He stared at her. 

“Sorry?” 

“Xenophilius Lovegood. Luna’s father. I want to go 
and talk to him!” 

“Er — why?” 



Page | 443 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, 
and said, “It’s that mark, the mark in Beedle the 
Bard. Look at this!” 

She thrust The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore 
under Harry’s unwilling eyes and he saw a 
photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had 
written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore ’s familiar thin, 
slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof 
that Dumbledore really had written those words, that 
they had not been Rita’s invention. 

“The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the 
signature, Harry!” 

He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she 
was talking about, but, looking more closely with the 
aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had 
replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the 
same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard. 

“Er — what are you — ?” said Ron tentatively, but 
Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to 
Harry. 

“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know 
Viktor said it was Grindelwald ’s mark, but it was 
definitely on that old grave in Godric’s Hollow, and 
the dates on the headstone were long before 
Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t 
ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means — I 
don’t even know whether Grindelwald’s still alive — 
but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the 
symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important, 
Harry!” 

Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her 
intense, eager face and then out into the surrounding 

Page | 444 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, 
“Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow. 

We talked ourselves into going there, and — ” 

“But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me 
The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we’re 
not supposed to find out about the sign?” 

“Here we go again!” Harry felt slightly exasperated. 

“We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left 
us secret signs and clues — ” 

“The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” 
piped up Ron. “I think Hermione’s right, I think we 
ought to go and see Lovegood.” 

Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that 
Ron’s support of Hermione had little to do with a 
desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. 

“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, 
“Lovegood’s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been 
for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they’ve got 
to help you!” 

“I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly. 

“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would 
have told me about it before he died?” 

“Maybe ... maybe it’s something you need to find out 
for yourself,” said Hermione with a faint air of 
clutching at straws. 

“Yeah,” said Ron sycophantically, “that makes sense.” 

“No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think 
we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links 



Page | 445 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow? 
Harry, I’m sure we ought to know about this!” 



“I think we should vote on it,” said Ron. “Those in 
favor of going to see Lovegood — ” 

His hand flew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips 
quivered suspiciously as she raised her own. 

“Outvoted, Harry, sorry,” said Ron, clapping him on 
the back. 

“Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated. “Only, 
once we’ve seen Lovegood, let’s try and look for some 
more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegoods 
live, anyway? Do either of you know?” 

“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron. “I 
dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point 
toward the hills whenever they mention them. 
Shouldn’t be hard to find.” 

When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry 
lowered his voice. 

“You only agreed to try and get back in her good 
books.” 

“All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and 
this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas 
holidays, Luna ’ll be home!” 

They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. 
Catchpole from the breezy hillside to which they 
Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage 
point the village looked like a collection of toy houses 
in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to 
earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a 
minute or two looking toward the Burrow, their hands 
Page | 446 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out 
were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which 
afforded the crooked little house protection from 
Muggle eyes. 

“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” 
said Ron. 

“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You 
were there for Christmas,” said Hermione coldly. 

“I wasn’t at the Burrow!” said Ron with an 
incredulous laugh. “Do you think I was going to go 
back there and tell them all I’d walked out on you? 
Yeah, Fred and George would’ve been great about it. 
And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.” 

“But where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, 
surprised. 

“Bill and Fleur’s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill’s 
always been decent to me. He — he wasn’t impressed 
when he heard what I’d done, but he didn’t go on 
about it. He knew I was really sorry. None of the rest 
of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and 
Fleur weren’t going home for Christmas because they 
wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after 
they were married. I don’t think Fleur minded. You 
know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.” 

Ron turned his back on the Burrow. 

“Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the 
top of the hill. 

They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione ’s 
insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The 
cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart 
from one small cottage, which seemed deserted. 

Page | 447 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for 
Christmas?” said Hermione, peering through the 
window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the 
windowsill. Ron snorted. 

“Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived 
there if you looked through the Lovegoods’ window. 
Let’s try the next lot of hills.” 

So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. 

“Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair 
and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, toward the top 
of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most 
strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, 
a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging 
behind it in the afternoon sky. “That’s got to be 
Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that? 
It looks like a giant rook!” 

“It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at 
the tower. 

“I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle 
to you.” 

Ron’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of 
the hill first. When Harry and Hermione caught up 
with him, panting and clutching stitches in their 
sides, they found him grinning broadly. 

“It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.” 

Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a 
broken-down gate. The first read, 

THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD 

the second, 

Page | 448 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE 



the third, 

KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS 

The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging 
path leading to the front door was overgrown with a 
variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in the 
orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as 
earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff 
and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged 
crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of 
leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and 
bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe, stood 
sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl 
with a slightly flattened, hawklike head peered down 
at them from one of the branches. 

“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,” 
said Hermione. “It’s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, 
not us.” 

He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to 
stow in the beaded bag. She then rapped three times 
on the thick black door, which was studded with iron 
nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle. 

Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung 
open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot 
and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt 
His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and 
unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at 
Bill and Fleur’s wedding by comparison. 

“What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” 
he cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking 
first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, 



Page | 449 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical 

O. 



“Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his 
hand. “I’m Harry, Harry Potter.” 

Xenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the 
eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid 
straight to the scar on Harry’s forehead. 

“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. 
“There’s something we’d like to ask you.” 

“I ... I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered 
Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look 
around the garden. “Rather a shock ... My word ... I 
... I’m afraid I don’t really think I ought to — ” 

“It won’t take long,” said Harry, slightly disappointed 
by this less-than-warm welcome. 

“I — oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. QuicklyV’ 

They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius 
slammed the door shut behind them. They were 
standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever 
seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that it felt 
like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was 
curved to fit the walls — the stove, the sink, and the 
cupboards — and all of it had been painted with 
flowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. 
Harry thought he recognized Luna’s style: The effect, 
in such an enclosed space, was slightly 
overwhelming. 

In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral 
staircase led to the upper levels. There was a great 
deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: 
Harry wondered what Luna could be doing. 

Page | 450 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking 
extremely uncomfortable, and he led the way. 

The room above seemed to be a combination of living 
room and workplace, and as such, was even more 
cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and 
entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the 
Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion 
that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth 
comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were 
piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. 
Delicately made models of creatures Harry did not 
recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung 
from the ceiling. 

Luna was not there: The thing that was making such 
a racket was a wooden object covered in magically 
turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre 
offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but 
after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old- 
fashioned printing press, due to the fact that it was 
churning out Quibblers. 

“Excuse me,” said Xenophilius, and he strode over to 
the machine, seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath 
an immense number of books and papers, which all 
tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, 
somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He 
then faced Harry. 

“Why have you come here?” 

Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out 
a small cry of shock. 

“Mr. Lovegood — what’s that?” 

She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, 
not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been 

Page | 451 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the 
room. 

“It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said 
Xenophilius. 

“No it isn’t!” said Hermione. 

“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not 
the moment — ” 

“But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B 
Tradeable Material and it’s an extraordinarily 
dangerous thing to have in a house!” 

“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, 
edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given 
the extreme clutter of the room. 

“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where 
to Find Them .! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it 
straightaway, don’t you know it can explode at the 
slightest touch?” 

“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius 
very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, “is a shy 
and highly magical creature, and its horn — ” 

“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings 
around the base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s 
incredibly dangerous — I don’t know where you got it 



“I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two 
weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew 
of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas 
surprise for my Luna. Now,” he said, turning to 
Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?” 



Page | 452 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione 
could start again. 



“Ah,” said Xenophilius. “Help. Hmm.” 

His good eye moved again to Harry’s scar. He seemed 
simultaneously terrified and mesmerized. 

“Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather 
dangerous ...” 

“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s 
their first duty to help Harry?” said Ron. “In that 
magazine of yours?” 

Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed 
printing press, still banging and clattering beneath 
the tablecloth. 

“Er — yes, I have expressed that view. However — ” 

“That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally?” 
said Ron. 

Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his 
eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the 
impression that he was undergoing some painful 
internal struggle. 

“Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione. “Let’s see what she 
thinks.” 

Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. 
Finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over 
the noise of the printing press, “Luna is down at the 
stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She ... she 
will like to see you. I’ll go and call her and then — 
yes, very well. I shall try to help you.” 

Page | 453 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they 
heard the front door open and close. They looked at 
each other. 

“Cowardly old wart,” said Ron. “Luna’s got ten times 
his guts.” 

“He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them 
if the Death Eaters find out I was here,” said Harry. 

“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old 
hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying 
to worm out of it himself. And for heaven’s sake keep 
away from that horn.” 

Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the 
room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon 
lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were 
very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he 
stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible 
beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there 
somewhere. They were closer to each other today than 
they had been since Bill and Fleur’s wedding, but she 
could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, 
thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it; 
anyone he came into contact with was in danger, 
Xenophilius’s attitude proved that. 

He turned away from the window and his gaze fell 
upon another peculiar object standing upon the 
cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a 
beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most 
bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that 
resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the 
sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to 
a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, 
while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a 
second strap around her forehead. 



Page | 454 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Look at this,” said Harry. 



“Fetching,” said Ron. “Surprised he didn’t wear that 
to the wedding.” 

They heard the front door close, and a moment later 
Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase 
into the room, his thin legs now encased in 
Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted 
teacups and a steaming teapot. 

“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, 
shoving the tray into Hermione’s arms and joining 
Harry at the statue’s side. “Modeled, fittingly enough, 
upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw. 

‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasureV ” 

He indicated the objects like ear trumpets. 

“These are the Wrackspurt siphons — to remove all 
sources of distraction from the thinker’s immediate 
area. Here,” he pointed out the tiny wings, “a billywig 
propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. 
Finally,” he pointed to the orange radish, “the 
Dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept 
the extraordinary.” 

Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which 
Hermione had managed to balance precariously on 
one of the cluttered side tables. 

“May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said 
Xenophilius. “We make it ourselves.” As he started to 
pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as 
beetroot juice, he added, “Luna is down beyond 
Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. 
She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly 
enough Plimpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit 
down and help yourselves to sugar. 

Page | 455 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an 
armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs 
crossed, “how may I help you, Mr. Potter?” 

“Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded 
encouragingly, “it’s about that symbol you were 
wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur’s 
wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.” 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. 

“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” 



Page | 456 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 





THE TALE OF THE THREE 
BROTHERS 

Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of 
them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius 
had said either. 

“The Deathly Hallows?” 

“That’s right,” said Xenophilius. “You haven’t heard of 
them? I’m not surprised. Very, very few wizards 
believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at 
your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron, “who 
attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known 
Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark 
about the Hallows — at least, not in that crude sense. 
One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other 
believers, in the hope that they might help one with 
the Quest.” 

He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot 
infusion and drank some. 



Page | 457 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I still don’t really 
understand.” 

To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and 
almost gagged: The stuff was quite disgusting, as 
though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every 
Flavor Beans. 

“Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,” 
said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in apparent 
appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. 

“But what are the Deathly Hallows?” asked Hermione. 

Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. 

“I assume that you are all familiar with “The Tale of 
the Three Brothers’?” 

Harry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione both said, 
“Yes.” Xenophilius nodded gravely. 

“Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 
The Tale of the Three Brothers’ ... I have a copy 
somewhere. ...” 

He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of 
parchment and books, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a 
copy, Mr. Lovegood, I’ve got it right here.” 

And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from 
the small, beaded bag. 

“The original?” inquired Xenophilius sharply, and 
when she nodded, he said, “Well then, why don’t you 
read it aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all 
understand.” 



Page | 458 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Er ... all right,” said Hermione nervously. She opened 
the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were 
investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a 
little cough, and began to read. 

“ ‘There were once three brothers who were traveling 
along a lonely, winding road at twilight — ’ ” 

“Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who 
had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. 
Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. 

“Sorry, I just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” 
said Ron. 

“Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our 
lives,” said Harry before he could stop himself. 
Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much 
attention, but was staring out of the window at the 
sky. “Go on, Hermione.” 

“ ‘In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to 
wade through and too dangerous to swim across. 
However, these brothers were learned in the magical 
arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made 
a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They 
were halfway across it when they found their path 
blocked by a hooded figure. 

“ ‘And Death spoke to them — ’ ” 

“Sorry,” interjected Harry, “but Death spoke to them?” 
“It’s a fairy tale, Harry!” 

“Right, sorry. Go on.” 

“ ‘And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had 
been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers 

Page | 459 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. 
He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon 
their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for 
having been clever enough to evade him. 

“ ‘So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, 
asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: 
a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a 
wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! 

So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the 
river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, 
and gave it to the oldest brother. 

“ ‘Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, 
decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, 
and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So 
Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it 
to the second brother, and told him that the stone 
would have the power to bring back the dead. 

“ ‘And then Death asked the third and youngest 
brother what he would like. The youngest brother was 
the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and 
he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that 
would enable him to go forth from that place without 
being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, 
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.’ ” 

“Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak?” Harry interrupted 
again. 

“So he can sneak up on people,” said Ron. 

“Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, 
flapping his arms and shrieking ... sorry, Hermione.” 

“ ‘Then Death stood aside and allowed the three 
brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, 
talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, 
and admiring Death’s gifts. 

Page | 460 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ ‘In due course the brothers separated, each for his 
own destination. 

“ ‘The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and 
reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard 
with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder 
Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel 
that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, 
the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he 
boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched 
from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. 

“ ‘That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest 
brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief 
took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest 
brother’s throat. 

“ ‘And so Death took the first brother for his own. 

“ ‘Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own 
home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone 
that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it 
thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, 
the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, 
before her untimely death, appeared at once before 
him. 

“ ‘Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by 
a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, 
she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the 
second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, 
killed himself so as truly to join her. 

“ ‘And so Death took the second brother for his own. 

“ ‘But though Death searched for the third brother for 
many years, he was never able to find him. It was only 
when he had attained a great age that the youngest 
brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and 

Page | 461 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old 
friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they 
departed this life. ’ ” 

Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two 
before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had 
stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze from the 
window and said, “Well, there you are.” 

“Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused. 

“Those are the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius. 

He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, 
and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between 
more books. 

“The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight 
vertical line upon the parchment. “The Resurrection 
Stone,” he said, and he added a circle on top of the 
line. “The Cloak of Invisibility,” he finished, enclosing 
both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol 
that so intrigued Hermione. “Together,” he said, “the 
Deathly Hallows.” 

“But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly 
Hallows’ in the story,” said Hermione. 

“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly 
smug. “That is a children’s tale, told to amuse rather 
than to instruct. Those of us who understand these 
matters, however, recognize that the ancient story 
refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, 
will make the possessor master of Death.” 

There was a short silence in which Xenophilius 
glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low 
in the sky. 



Page | 462 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said 
quietly. 

“When you say ‘master of Death’ — ” said Ron. 

“Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. 
“Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.” 

“But then ... do you mean ...” said Hermione slowly, 
and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any 
trace of skepticism out of her voice, “that you believe 
these objects — these Hallows — actually exist?” 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. 

“Well, of course.” 

“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her 
restraint starting to crack, “Mr. Lovegood, how can 
you possibly believe — ?” 

“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said 
Xenophilius. “You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but 
painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.” 

“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said 
Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His 
voice shook with the strain of not laughing. 

“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again. “We all know 
that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They 
are rare, but they exist. But — ” 

“Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of 
Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a 
traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, 
or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from 
Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade 
with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking 
Page | 463 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer 
completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving 
constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter 
what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you 
ever seen like that, Miss Granger?” 

Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it 
again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, 
and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that 
they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened 
that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just 
described was in the room with them at that very 
moment. 

“Exactly,” said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated 
them all in reasoned argument. “None of you have 
ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be 
immeasurably rich, would he not?” 

He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now 
tinged with the faintest trace of pink. 

“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the 
Cloak existed ... what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? 
The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?” 

“What of it?” 

“Well, how can that be real?” 

“Prove that it is not,” said Xenophilius. 

Hermione looked outraged. 

“But that’s — I’m sorry, but that’s completely 
ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn’t exist? 
Do you expect me to get hold of — of all the pebbles 
in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim 



Page | 464 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




that anything’s real if the only basis for believing in it 
is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t exist!” 

“Yes, you could,” said Xenophilius. “I am glad to see 
that you are opening your mind a little.” 

“So the Elder Wand,” said Harry quickly, before 
Hermione could retort, “you think that exists too?” 

“Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said 
Xenophilius. “The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is 
most easily traced, because of the way in which it 
passes from hand to hand.” 

“Which is what?” asked Harry. 

“Which is that the possessor of the wand must 
capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly 
master of it,” said Xenophilius. “Surely you have 
heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the 
Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of 
how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, 
Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful 
Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill, 
whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder 
Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding 
history.” 

Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at 
Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. 

“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” 
asked Ron. 

“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out 
of the window. “Who knows where the Elder Wand 
lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. 
Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, 



Page | 465 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and which took the wand? And who can say who may 
have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.” 

There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, 
“Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything 
to do with the Deathly Hallows?” 

Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted 
in Harry’s memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell 
...he had heard that name before. ... 

“But you have been misleading me, young woman!” 
said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in 
his chair and goggling at Hermione. “I thought you 
were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers 
believe that the Peverells have everything — 
everything ! — to do with the Hallows!” 

“Who are the Peverells?” asked Ron. 

“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, 
in Godric’s Hollow,” said Hermione, still watching 
Xenophilius. “Ignotus Peverell.” 

“Exactly!” said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised 
pedantically. “The sign of the Deathly Hallows on 
Ignotus ’s grave is conclusive proof!” 

“Of what?” asked Ron. 

“Why, that the three brothers in the story were 
actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, 
and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the 
Hallows!” 

With another glance at the window he got to his feet, 
picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral 
staircase. 



Page | 466 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You will stay for dinner?” he called, as he vanished 
downstairs again. “Everybody always requests our 
recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.” 

“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. 
Mungo’s,” said Ron under his breath. 

Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius 
moving about in the kitchen downstairs before 
speaking. 

“What do you think?” he asked Hermione. 

“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter 
rubbish. This can’t be what the sign really means. 
This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste 
of time.” 

“I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple- 
Horned Snorkacks,” said Ron. 

“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him. 

“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell 
kids to teach them lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking 
for trouble, don’t pick fights, don’t go messing around 
with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head 
down, mind your own business, and you’ll be okay’ 
Come to think of it,” Ron added, “maybe that story’s 
why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born 
witches will marry Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undone 
by midnight.’ ‘Wand of elder, never prosper.’ You 
must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.” 



Page | 467 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry and I were raised by Muggles,” Hermione 
reminded him. “We were taught different 
superstitions.” She sighed deeply as a rather pungent 
smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing 
about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it 
seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed 
at Ron. “I think you’re right,” she told him. “It’s just a 
morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one 
you’d choose — ” 

The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione 
said, “the Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry 
said, “the stone.” 

They looked at each other, half surprised, half 
amused. 

“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told 
Hermione, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if 
you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, 
come on!” 

“We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. 

“And it’s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn’t 
noticed!” said Hermione. “Whereas the wand would be 
bound to attract trouble — ” 

“Only if you shouted about it,” argued Ron. “Only if 
you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it 
over your head, and singing, ‘I’ve got an unbeatable 
wand, come and have a go if you think you’re hard 
enough.’ As long as you kept your trap shut — ” 

“Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?” said 
Hermione, looking skeptical. “You know, the only true 
thing he said to us was that there have been stories 
about extra- powerful wands for hundreds of years.” 



Page | 468 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“There have?” asked Harry. 



Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so 
endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at 
each other. 

“The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up 
under different names through the centuries, usually 
in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting 
about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of 
them, but — oh, it’s all nonsense. Wands are only as 
powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards 
just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better 
than other people’s.” 

“But how do you know,” said Harry, “that those 
wands — the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny — 
aren’t the same wand, surfacing over the centuries 
under different names?” 

“What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by 
Death?” said Ron. 

Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to 
him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded 
himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been 
made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night 
Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. And if it 
had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken? 

“So why would you take the stone?” Ron asked him. 

“Well, if you could bring people back, we could have 
Sirius ... Mad-Eye ... Dumbledore ... my parents. ...” 

Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. 

“But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t 
want to come back, would they?” said Harry, thinking 

Page | 469 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




about the tale they had just heard. “I don’t suppose 
there have been loads of other stories about a stone 
that can raise the dead, have there?” he asked 
Hermione. 

“No,” she replied sadly. “I don’t think anyone except 
Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that’s possible. 
Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer’s 
Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you 
immortal, a stone to reverse death.” 

The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It 
was something like burning underpants. Harry 
wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough 
of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his 
feelings. 

“What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. 
“Don’t you realize, he’s right? I’ve got so used to 
Harry’s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to 
think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s. It’s 
infallible. We’ve never been spotted under it — ” 

“Of course not — we’re invisible when we’re under it, 
Ron!” 

“But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and 
they’re not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It’s 
never occurred to me before, but I’ve heard stuff 
about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or 
them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes 
in. Harry’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly 
new, is it, but it’s just ... perfect!” 

“Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone ...” 

As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the 
room, only half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he 
raised his eyes absently to the next level and was 

Page | 470 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




distracted at once. His own face was looking back at 
him from the ceiling of the room above. 

After a moment’s bewilderment, he realized that it 
was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began 
to climb the stairs. 

“Harry, what are you doing? I don’t think you should 
look around when he’s not here!” 

But Harry had already reached the next level. 

Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five 
beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, 
Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the 
portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain 
magic about them all the same: Harry thought they 
breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains 
wove around the pictures, linking them together, but 
after examining them for a minute or so, Harry 
realized that the chains were actually one word, 
repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends . . . 
friends . . . friends . . . 

Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked 
around the room. There was a large photograph 
beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who 
looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked 
rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had 
ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This 
struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around. 

Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also 
thick with dust. There were no clothes in the 
wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a 
cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept 
in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the 
nearest window, across a bloodred sky. 



Page | 471 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as Harry descended 
the staircase, but before he could respond, 
Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the 
kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. 

“Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry. “Where’s Luna?” 

“Excuse me?” 

“Where’s Luna?” 

Xenophilius halted on the top step. 

“I — I’ve already told you. She is down at Bottom 
Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.” 

“So why have you only laid that tray for four?” 

Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. 
The only noise was the continued chugging of the 
printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as 
Xenophilius ’s hands shook. 

“I don’t think Luna’s been here for weeks,” said Harry. 
“Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn’t been slept in. 
Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the 
window?” 

Xenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and 
smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their 
wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his 
pocket. At that moment the printing press gave a 
huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming 
across the floor from underneath the tablecloth; the 
press fell silent at last. 

Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the 
magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood. 



Page | 472 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry, look at this.” 



He strode over to her as quickly as he could through 
all the clutter. The front of The Quibbler carried his 
own picture, emblazoned with the words 
UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE and captioned with 
the reward money. 

“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” Harry 
asked coldly, his mind working very fast. “Is that 
what you were doing when you went into the garden, 
Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry?” 

Xenophilius licked his lips. 

“They took my Luna,” he whispered. “Because of what 
I’ve been writing. They took my Luna and I don’t know 
where she is, what they’ve done to her. But they 
might give her back to me if I — if I — ” 

“Hand over Harry?” Hermione finished for him. 

“No deal,” said Ron flatly. “Get out of the way, we’re 
leaving.” 

Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips 
drawn back into a dreadful leer. 

“They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I 
cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.” 

He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and 
Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the 
same thing in front of his crib. 

“Don’t make us hurt you,” Harry said. “Get out of the 
way, Mr. Lovegood.” 

“HARRY!” Hermione screamed. 

Page | 473 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. 
As the three of them looked away from him, 
Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their 
mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways, 
shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm’s way as 
Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room 
and hit the Erumpent horn. 

There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it 
seemed to blow the room apart: Fragments of wood 
and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with 
an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew 
through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to 
see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his 
head. He heard Hermione’s scream, Ron’s yell, and a 
series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him 
that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and 
fallen backward down the spiral stairs. 

Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He 
could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the 
ceiling had fallen in, and the end of Luna’s bed was 
hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena 
Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, 
fragments of torn parchment were floating through 
the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, 
blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then 
another white shape moved close by, and Hermione, 
coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger 
to her lips. 

The door downstairs crashed open. 

“Didn’t I tell you there was no need to hurry, 

Travers?” said a rough voice. “Didn’t 1 tell you this 
nutter was just raving as usual?” 

There was a bang and a scream of pain from 
Xenophilius. 

Page | 474 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No ... no ... upstairs ... Potter!” 

“I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren’t coming 
back for anything less than some solid information! 
Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your 
daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress? And the 
week before” — another bang, another squeal — 
“when you thought we’d give her back if you offered 
us proof there are Crumple” — bang — “Headed” — 
bang — “Snorkacks?” 

“No — no — I beg you!” sobbed Xenophilius. “It really 
is Potter! Really!” 

“And now it turns out you only called us here to try 
and blow us up!” roared the Death Eater, and there 
was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of 
agony from Xenophilius. 

“The place looks like it’s about to fall in, Selwyn,” said 
a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled 
staircase. “The stairs are completely blocked. Could 
try clearing it? Might bring the place down.” 

“You lying piece of filth,” shouted the wizard named 
Selwyn. “You’ve never seen Potter in your life, have 
you? Thought you’d lure us here to kill us, did you? 
And you think you’ll get your girl back like this?” 

“I swear ... I swear ... Potter’s upstairs!” 

“Homenum revelio,” said the voice at the foot of the 
stairs. 

Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd 
sensation that something was swooping low over him, 
immersing his body in its shadow. 



Page | 475 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“There’s someone up there all right, Selwyn,” said the 
second man sharply. 



“It’s Potter, I tell you, it’s Potter!” sobbed Xenophilius. 
“Please ... please ... give me Luna, just let me have 
Luna. ...” 

“You can have your little girl, Lovegood,” said Selwyn, 
“if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry 
Potter. But if this is a plot, if it’s a trick, if you’ve got 
an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we’ll 
see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to 
bury.” 

Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There 
were scurryings and scrapings: Xenophilius was 
trying to get through the debris on the stairs. 

“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of 
here.” 

He started to dig himself out under cover of all the 
noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron 
was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as 
quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where 
he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his 
legs. While Xenophilius ’s banging and scraping drew 
nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron 
with the use of a Hover Charm. 

“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing 
press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; 
Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still 
white with dust. “Do you trust me, Harry?” 

Harry nodded. 

“Okay then,” Hermione whispered, “give me the 
Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you’re going to put it on.” 

Page | 476 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Me? But Harry — ” 



“Please, Ron\ Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, 
grab my shoulder.” 

Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath 
the Cloak. The printing press blocking the stairs was 
vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a 
Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione 
was waiting for. 

“Hold tight,” she whispered. “Hold tight ... any second 



Xenophilius’s paper- white face appeared over the top 
of the sideboard. 

“Obliviate\” cried Hermione, pointing her wand first 
into his face, then at the floor beneath them. 
“Deprimo\” 

She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They 
fell like boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for 
dear life; there was a scream from below, and he 
glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast 
quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all 
around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione 
twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing 
house rang in Harry’s ears as she dragged him once 
more into darkness. 



Page | 477 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE DEATHLY HALLOWS 

Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at 
once. They seemed to have landed in the corner of a 
field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a 
circle around them, waving her wand. 

“Protego Totalum ... Salvio Hexia ...” 

“That treacherous old bleeder!” Ron panted, emerging 
from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to 
Harry. “Hermione, you’re a genius, a total genius, I 
can’t believe we got out of that!” 

“ Cave Inimicum ... Didn’t I say it was an Erumpent 
horn, didn’t I tell him? And now his house has been 
blown apart!” 

“Serves him right,” said Ron, examining his torn jeans 
and the cuts to his legs. “What d’you reckon they’ll do 
to him?” 

“Oh, I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione. 
“That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a 



Page | 478 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew 
Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!” 



“Why hide me, though?” asked Ron. 

“You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit, Ron! 
They’ve kidnapped Luna because her father 
supported Harry! What would happen to your family if 
they knew you’re with him?” 

“But what about your mum and dad?” 

“They’re in Australia,” said Hermione. “They should 
be all right. They don’t know anything.” 

“You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed. 

“Yeah, you are, Hermione,” agreed Harry fervently. “I 
don’t know what we’d do without you.” 

She beamed, but became solemn at once. 

“What about Luna?” 

“Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still alive — 
” began Ron. 

“Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. 

“She must be alive, she must!” 

“Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron. 
“Whether she survives the place, though ... Loads 
don’t. ...” 

“She will,” said Harry. He could not bear to 
contemplate the alternative. “She’s tough, Luna, 
much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably 
teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and 
Nargles.” 

Page | 479 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I hope you’re right,” said Hermione. She passed a 
hand over her eyes. “I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if 



“ — if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death 
Eaters, yeah,” said Ron. 

They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where 
Ron made them tea. After their narrow escape, the 
chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, 
and friendly. 

“Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a 
few minutes’ silence. “Harry, you were right, it was 
Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of 
time! The Deathly Hallows ... such rubbish ... 
although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to have 
struck her, “he might have made it all up, mightn’t 
he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly 
Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until 
the Death Eaters arrived!” 

“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder 
making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d 
think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught 
me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, 
because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a 
whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of 
pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon 
he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, 
just to keep us talking.” 

“Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione. 
“Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot 
of nonsense in all my life.” 

“Hang on, though,” said Ron. “The Chamber of 
Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?” 



Page | 480 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!” 



“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said 
Ron. “Harry’s Invisibility Cloak — ” 

“ The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said 
Hermione firmly. “A story about how humans are 
frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as 
hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have 
everything we need already!” 

“I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,” 
said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so 
disliked over in his fingers. 

“There’s no such thing, Harry!” 

“You said there have been loads of wands — the 
Deathstick and whatever they were called — ” 

“All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder 
Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?” Her 
fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, 
and her tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic can raise 
the dead, and that’s that!” 

“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it 
made my mum and dad appear ... and Cedric ...” 

“But they weren’t really back from the dead, were 
they?” said Hermione. “Those kinds of — of pale 
imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone 
back to life.” 

“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, 
did she? The story says that once people are dead, 
they belong with the dead. But the second brother 
still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even 
lived with her for a while. ...” 

Page | 481 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He saw concern and something less easily definable 
in Hermione’s expression. Then, as she glanced at 
Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared 
her with his talk of living with dead people. 

“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s 
Hollow,” he said hastily, trying to sound robustly 
sane, “you don’t know anything about him, then?” 

“No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of 
subject. “I looked him up after I saw the mark on his 
grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything 
important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The 
only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’ is 
Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed 
it from Kreacher,” she explained as Ron raised his 
eyebrows. “It lists the pure-blood families that are 
now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells 
were one of the earliest families to vanish.” 

“ ‘Extinct in the male line’?” repeated Ron. 

“It means the name’s died out,” said Hermione, 
“centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could 
still have descendants, though, they’d just be called 
something different.” 

And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the 
memory that had stirred at the sound of the name 
“Peverell”: a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring 
in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, 
“Marvolo Gaunt!” 

“Sorry?” said Ron and Hermione together. 

“Marvolo Gaunti You -Know- Who’s grandfather! In the 
Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he 
was descended from the Peverells!” 



Page | 482 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. 



“The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo 
Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I 
saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s 
face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!” 

“The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. 
“Could you see what it looked like?” 

“Not really,” said Harry, trying to remember. “There 
was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; 
maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close 
up after it had been cracked open.” 

Harry saw Hermione ’s comprehension in the sudden 
widening of her eyes. Ron was looking from one to the 
other, astonished. 

“Blimey ... You reckon it was this sign again? The 
sign of the Hallows?” 

“Why not?” said Harry excitedly. “Marvolo Gaunt was 
an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared 
about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed 
down through the centuries, he might not have 
known what it really was. There were no books in that 
house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy 
tales to his kids. He’d have loved to think the 
scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because 
as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made 
you practically royal.” 

“Yes ... and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione 
cautiously, “but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think 
you’re think — ” 



Page | 483 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, why not? Why not?” said Harry, abandoning 
caution. “It was a stone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron 
for support. “What if it was the Resurrection Stone?” 

Ron’s mouth fell open. 

“Blimey — but would it still work if Dumbledore broke 
— ?” 

“Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such 
thing as a Resurrection Stone\” 

Hermione had leapt to her feet, looking exasperated 
and angry. “Harry, you’re trying to fit everything into 
the Hallows story — ” 

“Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of 
its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows 
was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from 
the Peverells!” 

“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on 
the stone properly!” 

“Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked 
Harry. “What did Dumbledore do with it after he 
broke it open?” 

But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond 
Ron and Hermione ’s. ... 

Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make 
the possessor master of Death . . . Master . . . Conqueror 
... Vanquisher ... The last enemy that shall be 
destroyed is death. . . . 

And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing 
Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no match ... 

Neither can live while the other survives. ... Was this 

Page | 484 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a 
way, after all, to ensure that he was the one who 
triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly 
Hallows, would he be safe? 

“Harry?” 

But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out 
his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his 
fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had 
never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven 
years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly 
what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really 
and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and 
endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable 
concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it ... 

And then, with a gasp, he remembered — 

“Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents 
died!” 

His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, 
but he did not care. 

“My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the 
Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because 
he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is 
buried in Godric’s Hollow. ...” Harry was walking 
blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new 
vistas of truth were opening all around him. “He’s my 
ancestor! I’m descended from the third brother! It all 
makes sense!” 

He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, 
as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him 
protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to 
the other two. 



Page | 485 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry,” said Hermione again, but he was busy 
undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers 
shaking hard. 

“Read it,” he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into 
her hand. “Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, 
Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need 
a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm 
so powerful that he made himself completely invisible 
without one!” 

Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under 
a chair: He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled 
out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the 
newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw 
him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted 
inside him so that he shouted out. 

“IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring — it’s in the 
Snitch!” 

“You — you reckon?” 

He could not understand why Ron looked taken 
aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry: 

Everything fit, everything. . . . His Cloak was the third 
Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the 
Snitch he would have the second, and then all he 
needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder 
Wand, and then — 

But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All 
his excitement, all his hope and happiness were 
extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the 
darkness, and the glorious spell was broken. 

“That’s what he’s after.” 



Page | 486 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look 
even more scared. 

“You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.” 

He turned his back on their strained, incredulous 
faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense. 
Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was 
seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry 
walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about 
Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night, 
thinking. ... 

Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. 
Nobody could have told him The Tales of Beedle the 
Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had 
heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the 
Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew 
about them? 

Harry gazed into the darkness. ... If Voldemort had 
known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would 
have sought them, done anything to possess them: 
three objects that made the possessor master of 
Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, 
he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first 
place. Didn’t the simple fact that he had taken a 
Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate 
that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret? 

Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand 
without realizing its full power, without 
understanding that it was one of three . . . for the 
wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose 
existence was best known. ... The bloody trail of the 
Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of 
Wizarding history . . . 



Page | 487 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray 
and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He 
felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. 

He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see 
Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left 
them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter, Ron at her 
side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they realize how 
far they had traveled in the last few minutes? 

“This is it,” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the 
glow of his own astonished certainty. “This explains 
everything. The Deathly Hallows are real, and I’ve got 
one — maybe two — ” 

He held up the Snitch. 

“ — and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he 
doesn’t realize ... he just thinks it’s a powerful wand 



“Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and 
handing him back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think 
you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.” 

“But don’t you see? It all fits — ” 

“No, it doesn’t,” she said. “It doesn’t , Harry, you’re 
just getting carried away. Please,” she said as he 
started to speak, “please just answer me this: If the 
Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew 
about them, knew that the person who possessed all 
three of them would be master of Death — Harry, why 
wouldn’t he have told you? Why?” 

He had his answer ready. 

“But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out 
about them for yourself! It’s a Quest!” 

Page | 488 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




“But I only said that to try and persuade you to come 
to the Lovegoods’!” cried Hermione in exasperation. “I 
didn’t really believe it!” 

Harry took no notice. 

“Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. 
He let me try my strength, take risks. This feels like 
the kind of thing he’d do.” 

“Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is 
the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear 
instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That 
symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the Deathly 
Hallows, we can’t afford to get sidetracked — ” 

Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the 
Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to 
break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove 
to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly 
Hallows were real. 

She appealed to Ron. 

“You don’t believe in this, do you?” 

Harry looked up. Ron hesitated. 

“I dunno ... I mean ... bits of it sort of fit together,” 
said Ron awkwardly. “But when you look at the whole 
thing ...” He took a deep breath. “I think we’re 
supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what 
Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe ... maybe we should 
forget about this Hallows business.” 

“Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione. “I’ll take first 
watch.” 



Page | 489 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent 
entrance, bringing the action to a fierce full stop. 

But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the 
Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he 
could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled 
through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the 
Cloak, if he could just possess them all. ... 

I open at the close. ... But what was ‘the close’? Why 
couldn’t he have the stone now? If only he had the 
stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in 
person . . . and Harry murmured words to the Snitch 
in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, 
but the golden ball would not open. ... 

And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that 
hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? Harry 
wished his scar would burn and show him 
Voldemort’s thoughts, because for the first time ever, 
he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very 
same thing. . . . Hermione would not like that idea, of 
course. ... But then, she did not believe ... 

Xenophilius had been right, in a way . . . Limited. 
Narrow. Close-minded. The truth was that she was 
scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of 
the Resurrection Stone ... and Harry pressed his 
mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly 
swallowing it, but the cold metal did not yield. ... 

It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone 
in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and 
he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten 
all about her in his feverish contemplation of the 
Hallows. If only they could rescue her; but dementors 
in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. 

Now he came to think about it, he had not yet tried 
casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand. ... He 
must try that in the morning. . . . 

Page | 490 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




If only there was a way of getting a better wand . . . 

And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, 
unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once more. ... 

They packed up the tent next morning and moved on 
through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour 
pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the 
tent that night, and persisted through the whole 
week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found 
bleak and depressing. He could think only of the 
Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been 
lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione ’s flat 
disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could 
extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the 
Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made 
him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined 
indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for 
dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his 
certainty, which remained absolute. Harry’s belief in 
and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much 
that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their 
obsession with the Horcruxes. 

“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low fierce voice, 
when Harry was careless enough to use the word one 
evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack 
of interest in locating more Horcruxes. “We’re not the 
ones with an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying 
to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!” 

But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. 
Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for 
Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry 
remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone 
hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the 
other survives. ... master of Death ... Why didn’t Ron 
and Hermione understand? 



Page | 491 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’ ” 
Harry quoted calmly. 

“I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to 
be fighting?” Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up 
on her. 

Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other 
two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to 
Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only 
other thing that mattered to him was that his scar 
had begun to prickle again, although he did all he 
could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought 
solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed 
by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were 
sharing had changed in quality; they had become 
blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and 
out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the 
indistinct features of an object that looked like a 
skull, and something like a mountain that was more 
shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as 
reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was 
worried that the connection between himself and 
Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he 
both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, 
prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, 
vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it 
was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no 
longer see into Voldemort’s mind as well as before. 

As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but 
notice, even through his new self-absorption, that 
Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he 
was determined to make up for having walked out on 
them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into 
listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership 
qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and 
exhorting the other two into action. 



Page | 492 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Three Horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “We need a 
plan of action, come on! Where haven’t we looked? 
Let’s go through it again. The orphanage ...” 

Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and 
Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom 
Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, 
Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry 
joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He 
would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying 
to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about 
the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to 
ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to 
keep them moving. 

“You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain. “Upper 
Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to 
live there. Let’s go and have a poke around.” 

These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought 
them within occasional sight of Snatchers. 

“Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death 
Eaters,” said Ron. “The lot that got me were a bit 
pathetic, but Bill reckons some of them are really 
dangerous. They said on Potterwatch — ” 

“On what?” said Harry. 

“ Potterwatch , didn’t I tell you that’s what it was 
called? The program I keep trying to get on the radio, 
the only one that tells the truth about what’s going 
on! Nearly all the programs are following You-Know- 
Who’s line, all except Potterwatch. I really want you to 
hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in. ...” 

Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to 
beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while 
the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch 

Page | 493 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




snatches of advice on how to treat dragon pox, and 
once a few bars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong 
Love.” While he tapped, Ron continued to try to hit on 
the correct password, muttering strings of random 
words under his breath. 

“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he 
told them. “Bill had a real knack for guessing them. 
I’m bound to get one in the end. ...” 

But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry 
was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, 
staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had 
forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron 
shouted excitedly from inside the tent. 

“I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was Altars’! Get in 
here, Harry!” 

Roused for the first time in days from his 
contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried 
back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione 
kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, 
who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just 
for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, 
staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most 
familiar voice was issuing. 

"... apologize for our temporary absence from the 
airwaves, which was due to a number of house calls 
in our area by those charming Death Eaters.” 

“But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione. 

“I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool, eh?” 

"... now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee 
was saying, “and I’m pleased to tell you that two of 



Page | 494 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




our regular contributors have joined me here this 
evening. Evening, boys!” 

“Hi.” 

“Evening, River.” 

“ ‘River,’ that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got 
code names, but you can usually tell — ” 

“Shh!” said Hermione. 

“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee 
went on, “let’s take a moment to report those deaths 
that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily 
Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is 
with great regret that we inform our listeners of the 
murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.” 

Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and 
Hermione gazed at one another in horror. 

“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is 
believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a 
second goblin, both believed to have been traveling 
with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have 
escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any 
knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters 
are desperate for news. 

“Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has 
been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities 
are attributing the deaths to a gas leak, but members 
of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the 
Killing Curse — more evidence, as if it were needed, of 
the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more 
than a recreational sport under the new regime. 



Page | 495 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the 
remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in 
Godric’s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several 
months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that 
her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries 
inflicted by Dark Magic. 

“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a 
minute’s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk 
Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the 
unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered 
by the Death Eaters.” 

Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not 
speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him 
was afraid of what might come next. It was the first 
time he had felt fully connected to the outside world 
for a long time. 

“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we turn to 
regular contributor Royal, for an update on how the 
new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.” 

“Thanks, River,” said an unmistakable voice, deep, 
measured, reassuring. 

“Kingsley!” burst out Ron. 

“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him. 

“Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their 
suffering as they continue to sustain heavy 
casualties,” said Kingsley. “However, we continue to 
hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches 
risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and 
neighbors, often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d 
like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their 
example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over 



Page | 496 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could 
be saved if such simple measures are taken.” 

“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners 
who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be 
Wizards first’?” asked Lee. 

“I’d say that it’s one short step from Wizards first’ to 
‘Purebloods first,’ and then to ‘Death Eaters,’ ” replied 
Kingsley. “We’re all human, aren’t we? Every human 
life is worth the same, and worth saving.” 

“Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for 
Minister of Magic if ever we get out of this mess,” said 
Lee. “And now, over to Romulus for our popular 
feature ‘Pals of Potter. ’ ” 

“Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice; Ron 
started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a 
whisper. 

“We know it’s Lupin\” 

“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time 
you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is 
still alive?” 

“I do,” said Lupin firmly. “There is no doubt at all in 
my mind that his death would be proclaimed as 
widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had 
happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at 
the morale of those resisting the new regime. The Boy 
Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which 
we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of 
innocence, the need to keep resisting.” 

A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. 
Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things 
he had said when they had last met? 

Page | 497 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was 
listening, Romulus?” 



“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, 
then hesitated slightly. “And I’d tell him to follow his 
instincts, which are good and nearly always right.” 

Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of 
tears. 

“Nearly always right,” she repeated. 

“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told 
me Lupin’s living with Tonks again! And apparently 
she’s getting pretty big too. ...” 

“... and our usual update on those friends of Harry 
Potter’s who are suffering for their allegiance?” Lee 
was saying. 

“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the 
more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now 
been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, 
erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,” said Lupin. 

“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron. 

“We have also heard within the last few hours that 
Rubeus Hagrid” — all three of them gasped, and so 
nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-known 
gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly 
escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where 
he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter’ 
party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken 
into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.” 

“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, 
if you’ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked 
Lee. 

Page | 498 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin 
gravely. “May I just add that while we here at 
Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge 
even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against 
following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’ parties 
are unwise in the present climate.” 

“Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest 
that you continue to show your devotion to the man 
with the lightning scar by listening to PotterwatcM 
And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard 
who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like 
to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to 
give his views on some of the more insane rumors 
circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new 
correspondent: Rodent.” 

“ ‘Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione cried out together: 

“Fred!” 

“No — is it George?” 

“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as 
whichever twin it was said, 

“I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to 
be ‘Rapier’!” 

“Oh, all right then. ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us 
your take on the various stories we’ve been hearing 
about the Chief Death Eater?” 

“Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners will 
know, unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a 
garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who’s 
strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a 
nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged 
Page | 499 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good 
nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.” 



“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air 
of mystery is creating more terror than actually 
showing himself.” 

“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm 
down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing 
stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You- 
Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. 
That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check 
whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If 
it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it 
really is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the 
last thing you ever do.” 

For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was 
laughing: He could feel the weight of tension leaving 
him. 

“And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?” 
asked Lee. 

“Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all 
the hard work he’s been putting in?” asked Fred. 
“Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false sense of 
security, thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he 
is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move 
faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo 
when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long 
way away if you’re planning on taking any risks. I 
never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety first!” 

“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” 
said Lee. “Listeners, that brings us to the end of 
another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be 
possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we 
shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next 
Page | 500 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




password will be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: 
Keep faith. Good night.” 



The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the 
tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices 
was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so 
used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that 
other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like 
waking from a long sleep. 

“Good, eh?” said Ron happily. 

“Brilliant,” said Harry. 

“It’s so brave of them,” sighed Hermione admiringly. 
“If they were found ...” 

“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. 
“Like us.” 

“But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry 
excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his thoughts 
turned again toward his all-consuming obsession. 
“He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew 
it!” 



“Harry — ” 

“Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not 
to admit it? Vol — ” 

“HARRY, NO!” 

“ — demort’s after the Elder Wand!” 

“The name’s Taboo!” Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet 
as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. “I told you, 
Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore — we’ve got

to put the protection back around us — quickly — it’s 
how they find — ” 

But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The 
Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to 
spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and 
nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the 
Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their 
lamps went out. 

“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a 
rasping voice through the darkness. “We know you’re 
in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at 
you and we don’t care who we curse!” 



Page | 502 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






MALFOY MANOR 

Harry looked around at the other two, now mere 
outlines in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her 
wand, not toward the outside, but into his face; there 
was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in 
agony, unable to see. He could feel his face swelling 
rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls 
surrounded him. 

“Get up, vermin.” 

Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the 
ground. Before he could stop them, someone had 
rummaged through his pockets and removed the 
blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruciatingly 
painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his 
fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had 
suffered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had 
been reduced to slits through which he could barely 
see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the 
tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of 
four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione 
outside too. 

Page | 503 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“Get — off — her!” Ron shouted. There was the 
unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron 
grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, “No! Leave 
him alone, leave him alone!” 

“Your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done 
to him if he’s on my list,” said the horribly familiar, 
rasping voice. “Delicious girl ... What a treat ... I do 
enjoy the softness of the skin. ...” 

Harry’s stomach turned over. He knew who this was: 
Fenrir Grey back, the werewolf who was permitted to 
wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired 
savagery. 

“Search the tent!” said another voice. 

Harry was thrown facedown onto the ground. A thud 
told him that Ron had been cast down beside him. 
They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were 
pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched. 

“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s 
gloating voice from overhead, and Harry was rolled 
over onto his back. A beam of wandlight fell into his 
face and Grey back laughed. 

“I’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. 
What happened to you, ugly?” 

Harry did not answer immediately. 

“I said,” repeated Greyback, and Harry received a 
blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in 
pain, “what happened to you?” 

“Stung,” Harry muttered. “Been stung.” 

“Yeah, looks like it,” said a second voice. 

Page | 504 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s your name?” snarled Greyback. 

“Dudley,” said Harry. 

“And your first name?” 

“I — Vernon. Vernon Dudley.” 

“Check the list, Scabior,” said Greyback, and Harry 
heard him move sideways to look down at Ron, 
instead. “And what about you, ginger?” 

“Stan Shunpike,” said Ron. 

“Like ’ell you are,” said the man called Scabior. “We 
know Stan Shunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.” 

There was another thud. 

“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his 
mouth was full of blood. “Bardy Weadley.” 

“A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you’re related to 
blood traitors even if you’re not a Mudblood. And 
lastly, your pretty little friend ...” The relish in his 
voice made Harry’s flesh crawl. 

“Easy, Greyback,” said Scabior over the jeering of the 
others. 

“Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a 
bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny. 
Who are you, girly?” 

“Penelope Clearwater,” said Hermione. She sounded 
terrified, but convincing. 

“What’s your blood status?” 



Page | 505 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Half-blood,” said Hermione. 



“Easy enough to check,” said Scabior. “But the ’ole lot 
of ’em look like they could still be ’ogwarts age — ” 

“Weh lebt,” said Ron. 

“Left, ’ave you, ginger?” said Scabior. “And you 
decided to go camping? And you thought, just for a 
laugh, you’d use the Dark Lord’s name?” 

“Nod a laugh,” said Ron. “Aggiden.” 

“Accident?” There was more jeering laughter. 

“You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s 
name, Weasley?” growled Greyback. “The Order of the 
Phoenix. Mean anything to you?” 

“Doh.” 

“Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, 
so the name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members 
have been tracked that way. We’ll see. Bind them up 
with the other two prisoners!” 

Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a 
short way, pushed him down into a sitting position, 
then started binding him back-to-back with other 
people. Harry was still half blind, barely able to see 
anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last 
the man tying them had walked away, Harry 
whispered to the other prisoners. 

“Anyone still got a wand?” 

“No,” said Ron and Hermione from either side of him. 

“This is all my fault. I said the name, I’m sorry — ” 

Page | 506 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry?” 



It was a new, but familiar, voice, and it came from 
directly behind Harry, from the person tied to 
Hermione’s left. 

“Dean?” 

“It is you! If they find out who they’ve got — ! They’re 
Snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for 
gold — ” 

“Not a bad little haul for one night,” Greyback was 
saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by 
Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the 
tent. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and three 
truants. You checked their names on the list yet, 
Scabior?” he roared. 

“Yeah. There’s no Vernon Dudley on ’ere, Greyback.” 

“Interesting,” said Greyback. “That’s interesting.” 

He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through 
the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, 
a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with 
pointed brown teeth and sores at the corners of his 
mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of 
the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, 
and blood. 

“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on 
that list under a different name? What House were 
you in at Hogwarts?” 

“Slytherin,” said Harry automatically. 



Page | 507 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that,” 
jeered Scabior out of the shadows. “But none of ’em 
can tell us where the common room is.” 

“It’s in the dungeons,” said Harry clearly. “You enter 
through the wall. It’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s 
under the lake, so the light’s all green.” 

There was a short pause. 

“Well, well, looks like we really ’ave caught a little 
Slytherin,” said Scabior. “Good for you, Vernon, 

’cause there ain’t a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who’s 
your father?” 

“He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied. He knew that 
his whole story would collapse with the smallest 
investigation, but on the other hand, he only had 
until his face regained its usual appearance before 
the game was up in any case. “Department of Magical 
Accidents and Catastrophes.” 

“You know what, Greyback,” said Scabior. “I think 
there is a Dudley in there.” 

Harry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, 
get them safely out of this? 

“Well, well,” said Greyback, and Harry could hear the 
tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice, and 
knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had 
indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry 
official. Harry’s heart was pounding against the ropes 
around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to 
know that Greyback could see it. “If you’re telling the 
truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to 
the Ministry. I expect your father’ll reward us just for 
picking you up.” 



Page | 508 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let 
us — ” 



“Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at 
this, Greyback!” 

A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry 
saw a glint of silver in the light of their wands. They 
had found Gryffindor’s sword. 

“Ve-e-ry nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it 
from his companion. “Oh, very nice indeed. Looks 
goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like 
this?” 

“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that 
it was too dark for Greyback to see the name etched 
just below the hilt. “We borrowed it to cut firewood — ” 

“ ’ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the 
Propheti” 

As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched 
tight across his distended forehead, burned savagely. 
More clearly than he could make out anything around 
him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet- 
black and forbidding; Voldemort’s thoughts had 
suddenly become razor-sharp again; he was gliding 
toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly 
euphoric purpose. ... 

So close ...So close . . . 

With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to 
Voldemort’s thoughts, pulling himself back to where 
he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in 
the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior. 



Page | 509 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ ‘’ermione Granger,’ ” Scabior was saying, “ ‘the 
Mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’arry 
Potter.’ ” 

Harry’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a 
supreme effort to keep himself present, not to slip 
into Voldemort’s mind. He heard the creak of 
Greyback’s boots as he crouched down in front of 
Hermione. 

“You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell 
of a lot like you.” 

“It isn’t! It isn’t me!” 

Hermione ’s terrified squeak was as good as a 
confession. 

“ ‘... known to be traveling with Harry Potter,’ ” 
repeated Grey back quietly. 

A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry’s scar 
was exquisitely painful, but he struggled with all his 
strength against the pull of Voldemort’s thoughts: It 
had never been so important to remain in his own 
right mind. 

“Well, this changes things, doesn’t it?” whispered 
Greyback. Nobody spoke: Harry sensed the gang of 
Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione ’s arm 
trembling against his. Greyback got up and took a 
couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down 
again to stare closely at his misshapen features. 

“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked 
softly, his breath foul in Harry’s nostrils as he 
pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar. 



Page | 510 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t touch it!” Harry yelled; he could not stop 
himself; he thought he might be sick from the pain of 
it. 



“I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed 
Greyback. 

“I found glasses!” yelped one of the Snatchers 
skulking in the background. “There was glasses in the 
tent, Greyback, wait — ” 

And seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed 
back onto his face. The Snatchers were closing in 
now, peering at him. 

“It is!” rasped Greyback. “We’ve caught Potter!” 

They all took several steps backward, stunned by 
what they had done. Harry, still fighting to remain 
present inside his own splitting head, could think of 
nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking 
across the surface of his mind — 

— He was gliding around the high walls of the black 
fortress — 

No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave 
danger — 

— looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest 
tower — 

He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in 
low voices — 

— Time to fly ... 

“...to the Ministry?” 

Page | 511 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“To hell with the Ministry,” growled Greyback. “They’ll 
take the credit, and we won’t get a look in. I say we 
take him straight to You-Know-Who.” 

“Will you summon ’im? ’ere?” said Scabior, sounding 
awed, terrified. 

“No,” snarled Greyback, “I haven’t got — they say he’s 
using the Malfoys’ place as a base. We’ll take the boy 
there.” 

Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling 
Voldemort. The werewolf might be allowed to wear 
Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but 
only Voldemort’s inner circle were branded with the 
Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted this 
highest honor. 

Harry’s scar seared again — 

— and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the 
window at the very top of the tower — 

"... completely sure it’s him? ’Cause if it ain’t, 
Greyback, we’re dead.” 

“Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his 
moment of inadequacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him 
plus his wand, that’s two hundred thousand Galleons 
right there! But if you’re too gutless to come along, 
any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get 
the girl thrown in!” 

— The window was the merest slit in the black rock, 
not big enough for a man to enter. ...A skeletal figure 
was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. . . . 
Dead, or sleeping ... ? 



Page | 512 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“All right!” said Scabior. “All right, we’re in! And what 
about the rest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with 



’em? 






“Might as well take the lot. We’ve got two Mudbloods, 
that’s another ten Galleons. Give me the sword as 
well. If they’re rubies, that’s another small fortune 
right there.” 

The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could 
hear Hermione’s breathing, fast and terrified. 

“Grab hold and make it tight. I’ll do Potter!” said 
Greyback, seizing a fistful of Harry’s hair; Harry could 
feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. “On 
three! One — two — three — ” 

They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. 
Harry struggled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, 
but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were 
squeezed tightly against him on either side, he could 
not separate from the group, and as the breath was 
squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully 
still — 

— as he forced himself through the slit of a window 
like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the 
cell-like room — 

The prisoners lurched into one another as they 
landed in a country lane. Harry’s eyes, still puffy, took 
a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of 
wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a 
long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. 
The worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not 
here. He was, Harry knew, for he was fighting to 
resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, 
at the top of a tower. How long it would take 



Page | 513 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that 
Harry was here, was another matter. ... 

One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook 
them. 

“How do we get in? They’re locked, Greyback, I can’t 
— blimey!” 

He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was 
contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract furls and 
coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a 
clanging, echoing voice: “State your purpose!” 

“We’ve got Potter!” Greyback roared triumphantly. 
“We’ve captured Harry Potter!” 

The gates swung open. 

“Come on!” said Greyback to his men, and the 
prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the 
drive, between high hedges that muffled their 
footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above 
him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He 
stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by Greyback; 
now he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to- 
back to the four other prisoners. Closing his puffy 
eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him 
for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was 
doing, whether he knew yet that Harry was caught. ... 

The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket 
and rolled over toward him, eyes opening in a skull of 
a face. ... The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes 
fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. 
Most of his teeth were gone. ... 

“So, you have come. I thought you would ... one day. 
But your journey was pointless. I never had it.” 

Page | 514 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ You lie]” 



As Voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him, Harry’s 
scar threatened to burst with pain, and he wrenched 
his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain 
present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel. 

Light spilled out over all of them. 

“What is this?” said a woman’s cold voice. 

“We’re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” 
rasped Greyback. 

“Who are you?” 

“You know me!” There was resentment in the 
werewolf’s voice. “Fenrir Greyback! We’ve caught 
Harry Potter!” 

Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to 
face the light, forcing the other prisoners to shuffle 
around too. 

“I know ’e’s swollen, ma’am, but it’s ’im!” piped up 
Scabior. “If you look a bit closer, you’ll see ’is scar. 
And this ’ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who’s been 
traveling around with ’im, ma’am. There’s no doubt 
it’s ’im, and we’ve got ’is wand as well! ’Ere, ma’am — ” 

Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy 
scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior thrust the 
blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows. 

“Bring them in,” she said. 

Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up 
broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits. 



Page | 515 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the 
hall. “My son, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. 
If that is Harry Potter, he will know.” 

The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; 
even with his eyes almost closed Harry could make 
out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal 
chandelier hung from the ceiling, more portraits 
against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from 
chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the 
prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers. 

“What is this?” 

The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius 
Malfoy fell on Harry’s ears. He was panicking now: He 
could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear 
mounted, to block out Voldemort’s thoughts, though 
his scar was still burning. 

“They say they’ve got Potter,” said Narcissa’s cold 
voice. “Draco, come here.” 

Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw 
him obliquely: a figure slightly taller than he was, 
rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed 
blur beneath white-blond hair. 

Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to 
place Harry directly beneath the chandelier. 

“Well, boy?” rasped the werewolf. 

Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great 
gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame. Through 
the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the 
first time since leaving Grimmauld Place. 



Page | 516 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature 
distorted by Hermione’s jinx. His black hair reached 
his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around 
his jaw. Had he not known that it was he who stood 
there, he would have wondered who was wearing his 
glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was 
sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact 
with Draco as the latter approached. 

“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. 
“Is it? Is it Harry Potter?” 

“I can’t — I can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping 
his distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of 
looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him. 

“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!” 

Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited. 

“Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the 
Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv — ” 

“Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, 
I hope, Mr. Malfoy?” said Greyback menacingly. 

“Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius 
impatiently. He approached Harry himself, came so 
close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale 
face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. 
With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he 
was peering out from between the bars of a cage. 

“What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback. 
“How did he get into this state?” 

“That wasn’t us.” 

“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” said Lucius. 

Page | 517 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




His gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead. 



“There’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be 
the scar, stretched tight. ... Draco, come here, look 
properly! What do you think?” 

Harry saw Draco’s face up close now, right beside his 
father’s. They were extraordinarily alike, except that 
while his father looked beside himself with 
excitement, Draco’s expression was full of reluctance, 
even fear. 

“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward 
the fireplace where his mother stood watching. 

“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to 
her husband in her cold, clear voice. “Completely sure 
that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord . . . 
They say this is his” — she was looking closely at the 
blackthorn wand — “but it does not resemble 
Ollivander’s description. ... If we are mistaken, if we 
call the Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember 
what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?” 

“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. 
Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers 
forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that 
the light fell on Hermione instead. 

“Wait,” said Narcissa sharply. “Yes — yes, she was in 
Madam Malkin’s with Potter! I saw her picture in the 
Prophett Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?” 

“I ... maybe ... yeah.” 

“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, 
striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron. “It’s 
them, Potter’s friends — Draco, look at him, isn’t it 
Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his name — ?” 

Page | 518 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah,” said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. 

“It could be.” 

The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A 
woman spoke, and the sound of the voice wound 
Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch. 

“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?” 

Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the 
prisoners, and stopped on Harry’s right, staring at 
Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes. 

“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood 
girl? This is Granger?” 

“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, 
we think, Potter! Potter and his friends, caught at 
last!” 

“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the 
better to take in Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the 
Dark Lord must be informed at once!” 

She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark 
Mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that 
she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved 
master — 

“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand 
actually closed upon Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her 
from touching the Mark. “I shall summon him, Bella, 
Potter has been brought to my house, and it is 
therefore upon my authority — ” 

“Your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench 
her hand from his grasp. “You lost your authority 
when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take 
your hands off me!” 

Page | 519 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture 
the boy — ” 

“Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,” interjected 
Greyback, “but it’s us that caught Potter, and it’s us 
that 11 be claiming the gold — ” 

“Gold!” laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off 
her brother-in-law, her free hand groping in her 
pocket for her wand. “Take your gold, filthy 
scavenger, what do I want with gold? I seek only the 
honor of his — of — ” 

She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon 
something Harry could not see. Jubilant at her 
capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and 
ripped up his own sleeve — 

“STOP!” shrieked Bellatrix. “Do not touch it, we shall 
all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!” 

Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own 
Mark. Bellatrix strode out of Harry’s limited line of 
vision. 

“What is that?” he heard her say. 

“Sword,” grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher. 

“Give it to me.” 

“It’s not yorn, missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it.” 

There was a bang and a flash of red light: Harry knew 
that the Snatcher had been Stunned. There was a 
roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand. 

“What d’you think you’re playing at, woman?” 



Page | 520 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Stupefyl” she screamed. “Stupefyl” 



They were no match for her, even though there were 
four of them against one of her: She was a witch, as 
Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. 
They fell where they stood, all except Greyback, who 
had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms 
outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw 
Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword 
of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face 
waxen. 

“Where did you get this sword?” she whispered to 
Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his 
unresisting grip. 

“How dare you?” he snarled, his mouth the only thing 
that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her. 

He bared his pointed teeth. “Release me, woman!” 

“Where did you find this sword?” she repeated, 
brandishing it in his face. “Snape sent it to my vault 
in Gringotts!” 

“It was in their tent,” rasped Greyback. “Release me, I 
say!” 

She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his 
feet, but appeared too wary to approach her. He 
prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails 
clutching its back. 

“Draco, move this scum outside,” said Bellatrix, 
indicating the unconscious men. “If you haven’t got 
the guts to finish them, then leave them in the 
courtyard for me.” 

“Don’t you dare speak to Draco like — ” said Narcissa 
furiously, but Bellatrix screamed, 

Page | 521 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can 
possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious 
problem!” 

She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the 
sword, examining its hilt. Then she turned to look at 
the silent prisoners. 

“If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,” she 
muttered, more to herself than to the others. “The 
Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself. . . . But 
if he finds out ... I must ... I must know. ...” 

She turned back to her sister again. 

“The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I 
think what to do!” 

“This is my house, Bella, you don’t give orders in my 



“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we are in!” 
shrieked Bellatrix. She looked frightening, mad; a 
thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned 
a hole in the carpet. 

Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the 
werewolf. 

“Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.” 

“Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply. “All except ... except for 
the Mudblood.” 

Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. 

“No!” shouted Ron. “You can have me, keep me!” 



Page | 522 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Bellatrix hit him across the face; the blow echoed 
around the room. 



“If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next,” she 
said. “Blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book. 
Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they 
are secure, but do nothing more to them — yet.” 

She threw Greyback’s wand back to him, then took a 
short silver knife from under her robes. She cut 
Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged 
her by the hair into the middle of the room, while 
Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to 
another door, into a dark passageway, his wand held 
out in front of him, projecting an invisible and 
irresistible force. 

“Reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s 
finished with her?” Greyback crooned as he forced 
them along the corridor. “I’d say I’ll get a bite or two, 
wouldn’t you, ginger?” 

Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down 
a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in 
danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any 
moment. At the bottom was a heavy door. Greyback 
unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them 
into a dank and musty room and left them in total 
darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar 
door had not died away before there was a terrible, 
drawn-out scream from directly above them. 

“HERMIONE!” Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe 
and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so 
that Harry staggered. “HERMIONE!” 

“Be quiet!” Harry said. “Shut up, Ron, we need to 
work out a way — ” 



Page | 523 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“HERMIONE! HERMIONE!” 



“We need a plan, stop yelling — we need to get these 
ropes off — ” 

“Harry?” came a whisper through the darkness. “Ron? 
Is that you?” 

Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of 
movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow 
moving closer. 

“Harry? Ron?” 

“Luna?” 

“Yes, it’s me! Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught!” 

“Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?” said 
Harry. 

“Oh yes, I expect so. ... There’s an old nail we use if 
we need to break anything. ... Just a moment ...” 

Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they 
could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her words 
were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, “HERMIONE! 
HERMIONE!” 

“Mr. Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying. “Mr. 
Ollivander, have you got the nail? If you just move 
over a little bit... I think it was beside the water jug. 



She was back within seconds. 
“You’ll need to stay still,” she said. 



Page | 524 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry could feel her digging at the rope’s tough fibers 
to work the knots free. From upstairs they heard 
Bellatrix’s voice. 

“I’m going to ask you again! Where did you get this 
sword? Where?” 

“We found it — we found it — PLEASE!” Hermione 
screamed again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and 
the rusty nail slipped onto Harry’s wrist. 

“Ron, please stay still!” Luna whispered. “I can’t see 
what I’m doing — ” 

“My pocket!” said Ron. “In my pocket, there’s a 
Deluminator, and it’s full of light!” 

A few seconds later, there was a click, and the 
luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked 
from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar: Unable 
to rejoin their sources, they simply hung there, like 
tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light. 
Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the 
motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, 
curled up on the floor in the corner. Craning around, 
he caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and 
Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, 
kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the 
humans. 

“Oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ron,” said Luna, 
and she began hacking at their bindings again. 

“Hello, Dean!” 

From above came Bellatrix’s voice. 

“You are lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You 
have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, 
tell the truth\” 

Page | 525 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Another terrible scream 



“HERMIONE!” 

“What else did you take? What else have you got? Tell 
me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with 
this knife!” 

“There!” 

Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his 
wrists, to see Ron running around the cellar, looking 
up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean, 
his face bruised and bloody, said “Thanks” to Luna 
and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto 
the cellar floor, looking groggy and disoriented, many 
welts across his swarthy face. 

Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand. 

“There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his 
fruitless efforts. “The cellar is completely escape- 
proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for 
a long time, he’s tried everything.” 

Hermione was screaming again: The sound went 
through Harry like physical pain. Barely conscious of 
the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run 
around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew 
what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. 

“What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! 
CRUCIO\” 

Hermione ’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, 

Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with 
his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized 
Hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped 
inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore’s Snitch and 
Page | 526 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




shook it, hoping for he did not know what — nothing 
happened — he waved the broken halves of the 
phoenix wand, but they were lifeless — the mirror 
fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a 
gleam of brightest blue — 

Dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. 

“Help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “We’re in 
the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!” 

The eye blinked and was gone. 

Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. 
He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and 
saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling 
of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming 
worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing, 
“HERMIONE! HERMIONE!” 

“How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix 
scream. “Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help 
you?” 

“We only met him tonight!” Hermione sobbed. “We’ve 
never been inside your vault. ... It isn’t the real sword! 
It’s a copy, just a copy! 

“A copy?” screeched Bellatrix. “Oh, a likely story!” 

“But we can find out easily!” came Lucius’s voice. 
“Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the 
sword is real or not!” 

Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was 
huddled on the floor. 



Page | 527 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed 
ear, “you must tell them that sword’s a fake, they 
mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook, please — ” 

He could hear someone scuttling down the cellar 
steps; next moment, Draco’s shaking voice spoke 
from behind the door. 

“Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don’t try 
anything, or I’ll kill you!” 

They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron 
clicked the Deluminator and the lights whisked back 
into his pocket, restoring the cellar’s darkness. The 
door flew open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out 
in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the 
little goblin by the arm and backed out again, 
dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut 
and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside 
the cellar. 

Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew 
back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the 
house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst. 

“DOB — !” 



Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and 
Ron looked terrified at his mistake. Footsteps crossed 
the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to 
Bellatrix. 

Dobby’s enormous, tennis-ball-shaped eyes were 
wide; he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his 
ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and 
it was clear that he was petrified. 

“Harry Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a 
voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.” 

Page | 528 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But how did you — ?” 



An awful scream drowned Harry’s words: Hermione 
was being tortured again. He cut to the essentials. 

“You can Disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked 
Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping. 

“And you can take humans with you?” 

Dobby nodded again. 

“Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and 
Mr. Ollivander, and take them — take them to — ” 

“Bill and Fleur’s,” said Ron. “Shell Cottage on the 
outskirts of Tinworth!” 

The elf nodded for a third time. 

“And then come back,” said Harry. “Can you do that, 
Dobby?” 

“Of course, Harry Potter,” whispered the little elf. He 
hurried over to Mr. Ollivander, who appeared to be 
barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker’s 
hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna 
and Dean, neither of whom moved. 

“Harry, we want to help you!” Luna whispered. 

“We can’t leave you here,” said Dean. 

“Go, both of you! We’ll see you at Bill and Fleur’s.” 

As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and 
for a few seconds he looked down, not upon the 
wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, 
just as thin, but laughing scornfully. 

Page | 529 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ Kill me, then, Voldemort, I welcome death! But my 
death will not bring you what you seek. . . . There is so 
much you do not understand. ...” 

He felt Voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione screamed 
again he shut it out, returning to the cellar and the 
horror of his own present. 

“Go!” Harry beseeched Luna and Dean. “Go! Well 
follow, just go!” 

They caught hold of the elf’s outstretched fingers. 
There was another loud crack, and Dobby, Luna, 
Dean, and Ollivander vanished. 

“What was that?” shouted Lucius Malfoy from over 
their heads. “Did you hear that? What was that noise 
in the cellar?” 

Harry and Ron stared at each other. 

“Draco — no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!” 

Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was 
silence. Harry knew that the people in the drawing 
room were listening for more noises from the cellar. 

“We’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he 
whispered to Ron. They had no choice: The moment 
anyone entered the room and saw the absence of 
three prisoners, they were lost. “Leave the lights on,” 
Harry added, and as they heard someone descending 
the steps outside the door, they backed against the 
wall on either side of it. 

“Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice. “Stand away 
from the door. I am coming in.” 



Page | 530 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed 
into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light 
from the three miniature suns floating in midair. 

Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him. 
Ron seized Wormtail’s wand arm and forced it 
upward; Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling 
his voice. Silently they struggled: Wormtail’s wand 
emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry’s 
throat. 

“What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from 
above. 

“Nothing!” Ron called back, in a passable imitation of 
Wormtail’s wheezy voice. “All fine!” 

Harry could barely breathe. 

“You’re going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to 
prise off the metal fingers. “After I saved your life? 

You owe me, Wormtail!” 

The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected 
it: He wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his 
hand over Wormtail’s mouth. He saw the ratlike 
man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: 
He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand 
had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had 
betrayed, and he continued to struggle more 
powerfully, as though to undo that moment of 
weakness. 

“And well have that,” whispered Ron, tugging 
Wormtail’s wand from his other hand. 

Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew’s pupils dilated in 
terror. His eyes had slid from Harry’s face to 
something else. His own silver fingers were moving 
inexorably toward his own throat. 

Page | 531 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No — ” 



Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back 
the hand, but there was no stopping it. The silver tool 
that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant 
had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; 
Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, 
his moment of pity; he was being strangled before 
their eyes. 

“No!” 

Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and 
Harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from 
around Wormtail’s throat, but it was no use. 

Pettigrew was turning blue. 

“Relashiol” said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver 
hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his 
knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a 
dreadful scream from overhead. Wormtail’s eyes rolled 
upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and 
was still. 

Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving 
Wormtail’s body on the floor behind them, ran up the 
stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading 
to the drawing room. Cautiously they crept along it 
until they reached the drawing room door, which was 
ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking 
down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor’s 
sword in his long-fingered hands. Hermione was lying 
at Bellatrix’s feet. She was barely stirring. 

“Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook. “Is it the true 
sword?” 

Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the 
prickling of his scar. 

Page | 532 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Griphook. “It is a fake.” 

“Are you sure?” panted Bellatrix. “Quite sure?” 

“Yes,” said the goblin. 

Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from 
it. 

“Good,” she said, and with a casual flick of her wand 
she slashed another deep cut into the goblin’s face, 
and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him 
aside. “And now,” she said in a voice that burst with 
triumph, “we call the Dark Lord!” 

And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her 
forefinger to the Dark Mark. 

At once, Harry’s scar felt as though it had split open 
again. His true surroundings vanished: He was 
Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was 
laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the 
summons he felt — he had warned them, he had told 
them to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If 
they were mistaken . . . 

“Kill me, then!” demanded the old man. “You will not 
win, you cannot win! That wand will never, ever be 
yours — ” 

And Voldemort’s fury broke: A burst of green light 
filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted 
from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and 
Voldemort returned to the window, his wrath barely 
controllable. ... They would suffer his retribution if 
they had no good reason for calling him back. . . . 

“And I think,” said Bellatrix’s voice, “we can dispose of 
the Mudblood. Greyback, take her if you want her.” 

Page | 533 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“NOOOOOOOOOOOO!” 



Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked 
around, shocked; she turned her wand to face Ron 
instead — 

“ ExpelliarmusV’ he roared, pointing Wormtail’s wand 
at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and was caught 
by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, 
Narcissa, Draco, and Greyback wheeled about; Harry 
yelled, “Stupefy\” and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto 
the hearth. Jets of light flew from Draco’s, Narcissa’s, 
and Greyback’s wands; Harry threw himself to the 
floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them. 

“STOP OR SHE DIES!” 

Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. 
Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, who seemed to be 
unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife 
to Hermione ’s throat. 

“Drop your wands,” she whispered. “Drop them, or 
we’ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!” 

Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail’s wand. Harry 
straightened up, still holding Bellatrix’s. 

“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade 
into Hermione’s throat: Harry saw beads of blood 
appear there. 

“All right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix’s 
wand onto the floor at his feet. Ron did the same with 
Wormtail’s. Both raised their hands to shoulder 
height. 

“Good!” she leered. “Draco, pick them up! The Dark 
Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!” 

Page | 534 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of 
it, and he could feel Voldemort flying through the sky 
from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon 
he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and 
Harry could see no way out. 

“Now,” said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to 
her with the wands, “Cissy, I think we ought to tie 
these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes 
care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will 
not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you 
have done tonight.” 

At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise 
from above. All of them looked upward in time to see 
the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and 
an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was 
directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw 
herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed 
to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, 
falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still 
clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of 
crystal flew in all directions: Draco doubled over, his 
hands covering his bloody face. 

As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, 
Harry took his chance: He leapt over an armchair and 
wrested the three wands from Draco’s grip, pointed all 
of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefyl” The 
werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew 
up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground. 

As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further 
harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair flying as 
she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had 
directed her wand at the doorway. 

“Dobby!” she screamed, and even Bellatrix froze. 

“You! You dropped the chandelier — ?” 

Page | 535 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger 
pointing at his old mistress. 

“You must not hurt Harry Potter,” he squeaked. 

“Kill him, Cissy!” shrieked Bellatrix, but there was 
another loud crack, and Narcissa’s wand too flew into 
the air and landed on the other side of the room. 

“You dirty little monkey!” bawled Bellatrix. “How dare 
you take a witch’s wand, how dare you defy your 
masters?” 

“Dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “Dobby is a 
free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and 
his friends!” 

Harry’s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he 
knew that they had moments, seconds before 
Voldemort was with them. 

“Ron, catch — and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the 
wands to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out 
from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning 
goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one 
shoulder, Harry seized Dobby’s hand and spun on the 
spot to Disapparate. 

As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of 
the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of 
Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was 
Ron’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s 
knife flew across the room at the place where he was 
vanishing — 

Bill and Fleur’s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur’s . . . 

He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could 
do was repeat the name of the destination and hope 

Page | 536 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his 
forehead pierced him, and the weight of the goblin 
bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of 
Gryffindor’s sword bumping against his back; Dobby’s 
hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was 
trying to take charge, to pull them in the right 
direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to 
indicate that that was fine with him. ... 

And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. 
Harry fell to his knees, relinquished Dobby’s hand, 
and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the 
ground. 

“Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but 
Griphook merely whimpered. 

Harry squinted around through the darkness. There 
seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the 
wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement 
outside it. 

“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” he whispered, 
clutching the two wands he had brought from the 
Malfoys’, ready to fight if he needed to. “Have we come 
to the right place? Dobby?” 

He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. 
“DOBBY!” 

The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, 
shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked down at 
the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf’s 
heaving chest. 

“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the 
cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!” 



Page | 537 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He did not know or care whether they were wizards or 
Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a 
dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and 
that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with 
a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him 
sideways on the cool grass. 

“Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die — ” 

The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with 
the effort to form words. 

“Harry ... Potter ...” 

And then with a little shudder the elf became quite 
still, and his eyes were nothing more than great 
glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they 
could not see. 



Page | 538 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 





THE WANDMAKER 

It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an 
instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore’s body 
at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in 
reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the 
grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife. Harry’s voice 
was still saying, “Dobby ... Dobby ...” even though he 
knew that the elf had gone where he could not call 
him back. 

After a minute or so he realized that they had, after 
all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and 
Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he 
knelt over the elf. 

“Hermione?” he said suddenly. “Where is she?” 

“Ron’s taken her inside,” said Bill. “She’ll be all right.” 

Harry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a 
hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf’s body, 
then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in 
it like a blanket. 

Page | 539 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; 
Harry listened to it while the others talked, discussing 
matters in which he could take no interest, making 
decisions. Dean carried the injured Griphook into the 
house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was 
making suggestions about burying the elf. Harry 
agreed without really knowing what he was saying. As 
he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his 
scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his 
mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long 
telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they 
had left behind at Malfoy Manor. His rage was 
dreadful and yet Harry’s grief for Dobby seemed to 
diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that 
reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean. 

“I want to do it properly,” were the first words of 
which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. “Not by 
magic. Have you got a spade?” 

And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, 
digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him 
at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug 
with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, 
glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his 
sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who 
had saved their lives. 

His scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he 
felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at 
last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very 
thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from 
Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to 
possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief 
for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry 
now, while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove 
Voldemort out ... though Dumbledore, of course, 
would have said that it was love. ... 



Page | 540 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold 
earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain 
in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the 
sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep 
him company, the things that had happened at the 
Malfoys’ returned to him, the things he had heard 
came back to him, and understanding blossomed in 
the darkness. ... 

The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his 
thoughts. Hallows ... Horcruxes ... Hallows ... 
Horcruxes ... Yet he no longer burned with that weird, 
obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out: 

He felt as though he had been slapped awake again. 

Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he 
knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom 
he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and 
why. ... 

And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one 
small unconscious impulse of mercy. . . . Dumbledore 
had foreseen that. ... How much more had he known? 

Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the 
darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was 
rejoined by Ron and Dean. 

“How’s Hermione?” 

“Better,” said Ron. “Fleur’s looking after her.” 

Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him 
why he had not simply created a perfect grave with 
his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down 
into the hole he had made with spades of their own, 
and together they worked in silence until the hole 
seemed deep enough.

Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron 
sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes 
and socks, which he placed upon the elf’s bare feet. 
Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed 
carefully upon Dobby’s head, muffling his batlike 
ears. 

“We should close his eyes.” 

Harry had not heard the others coming through the 
darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a 
large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded 
a bottle of what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. 
Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, 
pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm 
around her when she reached him. Luna, who was 
huddled in one of Fleur’s coats, crouched down and 
placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf’s 
eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. 

“There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.” 

Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny 
limbs so that he might have been resting, then 
climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little 
body. He forced himself not to break down as he 
remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and 
rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in 
the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s 
achievements, the stateliness of the white marble 
tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a 
funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a 
roughly dug hole. 

“I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. 
“I’ll go first, shall I?” 

And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the 
dead elf at the bottom of the grave. 

Page | 542 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from 
that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when 
you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember 
what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” 

She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who 
cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “Yeah ... 
thanks, Dobby.” 

“Thanks,” muttered Dean. 

Harry swallowed. 

“Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could 
manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised 
his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose 
up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, 
reddish mound. 

“D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the 
others. 

They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle 
pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back 
toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. 

He looked around: There were a number of large 
white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge 
of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest 
and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby ’s 
head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a 
wand. 

There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; 
he could not now remember whose wands these were; 
he seemed to remember wrenching them out of 
someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, 
which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the 
rock. 

Page | 543 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts 
appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that 
Hermione could have done it more neatly, and 
probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the 
spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry 
stood up again, the stone read: 

HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. 

He looked down at his handiwork for a few more 
seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a 
little, and his mind full of those things that had come 
to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the 
darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. 

They were all sitting in the living room when he 
entered the little hall, their attention focused upon 
Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, 
pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly 
in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon 
the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening. 

"... lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at 
Hogwarts, they could have taken her before we 
reached her. Now we know she’s safe too.” 

He looked around and saw Harry standing there. 

“I’ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,” he 
explained. “Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters 
know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the 
family — don’t apologize,” he added at the sight of 
Harry’s expression. “It was always a matter of time, 
Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest 
blood-traitor family there is.” 

“How are they protected?” asked Harry. 



Page | 544 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve 
done it on this cottage too; I’m Secret-Keeper here. 
None of us can go to work, but that’s hardly the most 
important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook 
are well enough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. 
There isn’t much room here, but she’s got plenty. 
Griphook’s legs are on the mend, Fleur’s given him 
Skele-Gro; we could probably move them in an hour 



or — 






“No,” Harry said, and Bill looked startled. “I need both 
of them here. I need to talk to them. It’s important.” 

He heard the authority in his own voice, the 
conviction, the sense of purpose that had come to him 
as he dug Dobby’s grave. All of their faces were 
turned toward him, looking puzzled. 

“I’m going to wash,” Harry told Bill, looking down at 
his hands, still covered in mud and Dobby’s blood. 
“Then 111 need to see them, straightaway.” 

He walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath 
a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking 
over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he 
washed, again following the train of thought that had 
come to him in the dark garden. ... 

Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent 
him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. 

A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror 
fragment, and then help had come. Help will always 
be given at Hog warts to those who ask for it 

Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of 
the scene outside the window and to the murmuring 
of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over 
the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, 
closer to the heart of it all. 

Page | 545 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




And still his scar prickled, and he knew that 
Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood 
and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling 
him one thing, his brain quite another. The 
Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry 
over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in 
prayer. 

You gave Ron the Deluminator. You understood him. . . . 
You gave him a way back. . . . 

And you understood Wormtail too. ... You knew there 
was a bit of regret there, somewhere. ... 

And if you knew them ... What did you know about 
me, Dumbledore? 

Am I meant to know, but not to seek? Did you know 
how hard I’d find that? Is that why you made it this 
difficult? So I’d have time to work that out? 

Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place 
where a bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising 
over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean 
hands and was momentarily surprised to see the 
cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and 
returned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar 
pulse angrily, and there flashed across his mind, swift 
as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline 
of a building he knew extremely well. 

Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. 

“I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,” Harry 
said. 

“No,” said Fleur. “You will ’ave to wait, ’Arry. Zey are 
both ill, tired — ” 



Page | 546 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m sorry,” he said without heat, “but it can’t wait. I 
need to talk to them now. Privately — and separately. 
It’s urgent.” 

“Harry, what the hell’s going on?” asked Bill. “You 
turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half- 
conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she’s 
been tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell me 
anything — ” 

“We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said Harry flatly. 
“You’re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left 
us a mission. We’re not supposed to talk about it to 
anyone else.” 

Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look 
at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply scarred 
face was hard to read. Finally Bill said, “All right. Who 
do you want to talk to first?” 

Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. 
There was hardly any time left; now was the moment 
to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows? 

“Griphook,” Harry said. “I’ll speak to Griphook first.” 

His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and 
had just cleared an enormous obstacle. 

“Up here, then,” said Bill, leading the way. 

Harry had walked up several steps before stopping 
and looking back. 

“I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and 
Hermione, who had been skulking, half concealed, in 
the doorway of the sitting room. 

They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. 

Page | 547 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“How are you?” Harry asked Hermione. “You were 
amazing — coming up with that story when she was 
hurting you like that — ” 

Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one- 
armed squeeze. 

“What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked. 

“You’ll see. Come on.” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep 
stairs onto a small landing. Three doors led off it. 

“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and 
Fleur’s room. It too had a view of the sea, now flecked 
with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, 
turned his back on the spectacular view, and waited, 
his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the 
chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. 

Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he 
set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted 
thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all. 

“I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry. “How 
are your legs?” 

“Painful,” replied the goblin. “But mending.” 

He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and 
wore a strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. 
Harry noted the goblin’s sallow skin, his long thin 
fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: 
His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house- 
elf, but not by much. His domed head was much 
bigger than a human’s. 

“You probably don’t remember — ” Harry began. 

Page | 548 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ — that I was the goblin who showed you to your 
vault, the first time you ever visited Gringotts?” said 
Griphook. “I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst 
goblins, you are very famous.” 

Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each 
other up. Harry’s scar was still prickling. He wanted 
to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, 
and at the same time was afraid of making a false 
move. While he tried to decide on the best way to 
approach his request, the goblin broke the silence. 

“You buried the elf,” he said, sounding unexpectedly 
rancorous. “I watched you from the window of the 
bedroom next door.” 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his 
slanting black eyes. 

“You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.” 

“In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar 
absently. 

“You dug the grave.” 

“So?” 

Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he 
was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it 
did not much matter to him whether Griphook 
approved of Dobby’s grave or not. He gathered himself 
for the attack. 

“Griphook, I need to ask — ” 

“You also rescued a goblin.” 

Page | 549 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What?” 



“You brought me here. Saved me.” 

“Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little 
impatiently. 

“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger 
he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but 
you are a very odd wizard.” 

“Right,” said Harry. “Well, I need some help, 

Griphook, and you can give it to me.” 

The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but 
continued to frown at Harry as though he had never 
seen anything like him. 

“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.” 

Harry had not meant to say it so baldly; the words 
were forced from him as pain shot through his 
lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of 
Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to 
deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were 
staring at Harry as though he had gone mad. 

“Harry — ” said Hermione, but she was cut off by 
Griphook. 

“Break into a Gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin, 
wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the 
bed. “It is impossible.” 

“No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him. “It’s been done.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I first met you, 
Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.” 



Page | 550 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“The vault in question was empty at the time,” 
snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that even 
though Griphook had left Gringotts, he was offended 
at the idea of its defenses being breached. “Its 
protection was minimal.” 

“Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and 
I’m guessing its protection will be pretty powerful,” 
said Harry. “It belongs to the Lestranges.” 

He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, 
astonished, but there would be time enough to 
explain after Griphook had given his answer. 

“You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly. “No 
chance at all. If you seek beneath our floors, a 
treasure that was never yours — ” 

“Thief you have been warned, beware — yeah, I 
know, I remember,” said Harry. “But I’m not trying to 
get myself any treasure, I’m not trying to take 
anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?” 

The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the 
lightning scar on Harry’s forehead prickled, but he 
ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its 
invitation. 

“If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that 
they did not seek personal gain,” said Griphook 
finally, “it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and 
elves are not used to the protection or the respect 
that you have shown this night. Not from wand- 
carriers.” 

“Wand-carriers,” repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly 
upon his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort 
turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned 
to question Ollivander next door. 

Page | 551 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, 
“has long been contested between wizards and 
goblins.” 

“Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said 
Ron. 

“That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the 
secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, they 
deny us the possibility of extending our powers!” 

“Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” 
said Ron. “You won’t tell us how to make swords and 
armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work 
metal in a way wizards have never — ” 

“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s 
rising color. “This isn’t about wizards versus goblins 
or any other sort of magical creature — ” 

Griphook gave a nasty laugh. 

“But it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord 
becomes ever more powerful, your race is set still 
more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under 
Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, and who 
amongst the wand-carriers protests?” 

“We do!” said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her 
eyes bright. “We protest! And I’m hunted quite as 
much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I’m a Mudblood!” 

“Don’t call yourself — ” Ron muttered. 

“Why shouldn’t I?” said Hermione. “Mudblood, and 
proud of it! I’ve got no higher position under this new 
order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose 
to torture, back at the Malfoys’!” 



Page | 552 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the 
dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had 
made, scarlet against her throat. 

“Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?” 
she asked. “Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to 
be freed for years?” (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on 
the arm of Hermione’s chair.) “You can’t want You- 
Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!” 

The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity 
he had shown Harry. 

“What do you seek within the Lestranges’ vault?” he 
asked abruptly. “The sword that lies inside it is a 
fake. This is the real one.” He looked from one to the 
other of them. “I think that you already know this. 

You asked me to lie for you back there.” 

“But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, 
is it?” asked Harry. “Perhaps you’ve seen the other 
things in there?” 

His heart was pounding harder than ever. He 
redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar. 

The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. 

“It is against our code to speak of the secrets of 
Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous 
treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our 
care, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers.” 

The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes 
roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back 
again. 

“So young,” he said finally, “to be fighting so many.” 



Page | 553 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Will you help us?” said Harry. “We haven’t got a hope 
of breaking in without a goblin’s help. You’re our one 
chance.” 

“I shall ... think about it,” said Griphook 
maddeningly. 

“But — ” Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in 
the ribs. 

“Thank you,” said Harry. 

The goblin bowed his great domed head in 
acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs. 

“I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon 
Bill and Fleur’s bed, “that the Skele-Gro has finished 
its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. ...” 

“Yeah, of course,” said Harry, but before leaving the 
room he leaned forward and took the sword of 
Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not 
protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the 
goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him. 

“Little git,” whispered Ron. “He’s enjoying keeping us 
hanging.” 

“Harry,” whispered Hermione, pulling them both away 
from the door, into the middle of the still-dark 
landing, “are you saying what I think you’re saying? 
Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in the Lestranges’ 
vault?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. “Bellatrix was terrified when she 
thought we’d been in there, she was beside herself. 
Why? What did she think we’d seen, what else did she 
think we might have taken? Something she was 
petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.” 

Page | 554 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But I thought we were looking for places You-Know- 
Who’s been, places he’s done something important?” 
said Ron, looking baffled. “Was he ever inside the 
Lestranges’ vault?” 

“I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” 
said Harry. “He never had gold there when he was 
younger, because nobody left him anything. He would 
have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first 
time he ever went to Diagon Alley.” 

Harry’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted 
Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts 
before they spoke to Ollivander. 

“I think he would have envied anyone who had a key 
to a Gringotts vault. I think he’d have seen it as a real 
symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don’t 
forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They 
were his most devoted servants before he fell, and 
they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it 
the night he came back, I heard him.” 

Harry rubbed his scar. 

“I don’t think he’d have told Bellatrix it was a 
Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy the 
truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a 
treasured possession and asked her to place it in her 
vault. The safest place in the world for anything you 
want to hide, Hagrid told me ... except for Hogwarts.” 

When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his 
head. 

“You really understand him.” 



Page | 555 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Bits of him,” said Harry. “Bits ... I just wish I’d 
understood Dumbledore as much. But well see. 

Come on — Ollivander now.” 

Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but impressed 
as they followed him across the little landing and 
knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur’s. A 
weak “Come in!” answered them. 

The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest 
from the window. He had been held in the cellar for 
more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at 
least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of 
his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish 
skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in their 
sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket 
could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on 
the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising 
sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff- top 
garden and the freshly dug grave. 

“Mr. Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said. 

“My dear boy.” Ollivander’s voice was feeble. “You 
rescued us. I thought we would die in that place. I 
can never thank you ... never thank you ... enough.” 

“We were glad to do it.” 

Harry’s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that 
there was hardly any time left in which to beat 
Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart 
him. He felt a flutter of panic ... yet he had made his 
decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. 
Feigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the 
pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of 
his broken wand. 

“Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.” 

Page | 556 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Anything. Anything,” said the wandmaker weakly. 

“Can you mend this? Is it possible?” 

Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry 
placed the two barely connected halves into his palm. 

“Holly and phoenix feather,” said Ollivander in a 
tremulous voice. “Eleven inches. Nice and supple.” 

“Yes,” said Harry. “Can you — ?” 

“No,” whispered Ollivander. “I am sorry, very sorry, 
but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage 
cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.” 

Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow 
nevertheless. He took the wand halves back and 
replaced them in the pouch around his neck. 
Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered 
wand had vanished, and did not look away until 
Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he 
had brought from the Malfoys’. 

“Can you identify these?” Harry asked. 

The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held 
it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between his 
knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly. 

“Walnut and dragon heartstring,” he said. “Twelve- 
and-three-quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand 
belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.” 

“And this one?” 

Ollivander performed the same examination. 



Page | 557 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. 
Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco 
Malfoy.” 



“Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?” 
“Perhaps not. If you took it — ” 

“— I did — ” 



“ — then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of 
taking matters. Much also depends upon the wand 
itself. In general, however, where a wand has been 
won, its allegiance will change.” 

There was silence in the room, except for the distant 
rushing of the sea. 

“You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said 
Harry, “like they can think for themselves.” 

“The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That 
much has always been clear to those of us who have 
studied wandlore.” 

“A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen 
them, though?” asked Harry. 

“Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to 
channel your magic through almost any instrument. 
The best results, however, must always come where 
there is the strongest affinity between wizard and 
wand. These connections are complex. An initial 
attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, 
the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from 
the wand.” 

The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a 
mournful sound. 

Page | 558 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said 
Harry. “Can I use it safely?” 

“I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but 
the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its 
new master.” 

“So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling 
Wormtail’s wand out of his pocket and handing it to 
Ollivander. 

“Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a- 
quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this 
shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, 
if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and 
do it well, than another wand.” 

“And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked 
Harry. 

“I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes 
upon Harry’s face. “You ask deep questions, Mr. 

Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch 
of magic.” 

“So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to 
take true possession of a wand?” asked Harry. 

Ollivander swallowed. 

“Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary 
to kill.” 

“There are legends, though,” said Harry, and as his 
heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar became 
more intense; he was sure that Voldemort had 
decided to put his idea into action. “Legends about a 
wand — or wands — that have passed from hand to 
hand by murder.” 

Page | 559 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he 
was light gray, and his eyes were enormous, 
bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. 

“Only one wand, I think,” he whispered. 

“And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn’t he?” 
asked Harry. 

“I — how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked 
appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. “How do 
you know this?” 

“He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the 
connection between our wands,” said Harry. 

Ollivander looked terrified. 

“He tortured me, you must understand that! The 
Cruciatus Curse, I — I had no choice but to tell him 
what I knew, what I guessed!” 

“I understand,” said Harry. “You told him about the 
twin cores? You said he just had to borrow another 
wizard’s wand?” 

Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount 
that Harry knew. He nodded slowly. 

“But it didn’t work,” Harry went on. “Mine still beat 
the borrowed wand. Do you know why that is?” 

Ollivander shook his head as slowly as he had just 
nodded. 

“I had ... never heard of such a thing. Your wand 
performed something unique that night. The 
connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet 



Page | 560 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




why your wand should have snapped the borrowed 
wand, I do not know. ...” 

“We were talking about the other wand, the wand that 
changes hands by murder. When You-Know-Who 
realized my wand had done something strange, he 
came back and asked about that other wand, didn’t 
he?” 

“How do you know this?” 

Harry did not answer. 

“Yes, he asked,” whispered Ollivander. “He wanted to 
know everything I could tell him about the wand 
variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of 
Destiny, or the Elder Wand.” 

Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked 
flabbergasted. 

“The Dark Lord,” said Ollivander in hushed and 
frightened tones, “had always been happy with the 
wand I made him — yew and phoenix feather, 
thirteen-and-a-half inches — until he discovered the 
connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, 
more powerful wand, as the only way to conquer 
yours.” 

“But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that 
mine’s broken beyond repair,” said Harry quietly. 

“No!” said Hermione, sounding frightened. “He can’t 
know that, Harry, how could he — ?” 

“Priori Incantatem,” said Harry. “We left your wand 
and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys’, Hermione. If 
they examine them properly, make them re-create the 
spells they’ve cast lately, they’ll see that yours broke 

Page | 561 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




mine, they’ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, 
and they’ll realize that I’ve been using the blackthorn 
one ever since.” 

The little color she had regained since their arrival 
had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a 
reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about 
that now — ” 

But Mr. Ollivander intervened. 

“The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only 
for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to 
possess it because he believes it will make him truly 
invulnerable.” 

“And will it?” 

“The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear 
attack,” said Ollivander, “but the idea of the Dark 
Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit 
... formidable.” 

Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been 
unsure, when they first met, of how much he liked 
Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and 
imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark wizard 
in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as 
much as it repulsed him. 

“You — you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. 
Ollivander?” asked Hermione. 

“Oh yes,” said Ollivander. “Yes, it is perfectly possible 
to trace the wand’s course through history. There are 
gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from 
view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it 
resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics 
that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. 
Page | 562 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There are written accounts, some of them obscure, 
that I and other wandmakers have made it our 
business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.” 

“So you — you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a 
myth?” Hermione asked hopefully. 

“No,” said Ollivander. “Whether it needs to pass by 
murder, I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that 
may be simply due to the fact that it is such a 
desirable object, and arouses such passions in 
wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong 
hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of 
us who study the power of wands.” 

“Mr. Ollivander,” said Harry, “you told You-Know-Who 
that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” 

Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked 
ghostly as he gulped. 

“But how — how do you — ?” 

“Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his 
eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for 
mere seconds, a vision of the main street in 
Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much 
farther north. “You told You-Know-Who that 
Gregorovitch had the wand?” 

“It was a rumor,” whispered Ollivander. “A rumor, 
years and years ago, long before you were born! I 
believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see 
how good it would be for business: that he was 
studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder 
Wand!” 

“Yes, I can see that,” said Harry. He stood up. “Mr. 
Ollivander, one last thing, and then we’ll let you get 

Page | 563 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




some rest. What do you know about the Deathly 
Hallows?” 



“The — the what?” asked the wandmaker, looking 
utterly bewildered. 

“The Deathly Hallows.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about. Is 
this still something to do with wands?” 

Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that 
Ollivander was not acting. He did not know about the 
Hallows. 

“Thank you,” said Harry. “Thank you very much. We’ll 
leave you to get some rest now.” 

Ollivander looked stricken. 

“He was torturing me!” he gasped. “The Cruciatus 
Curse ... you have no idea. ...” 

“I do,” said Harry. “I really do. Please get some rest. 
Thank you for telling me all of this.” 

He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry 
caught a glimpse of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean 
sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front 
of them. They all looked up at Harry as he appeared 
in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and 
continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind 
him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby 
lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in 
his head built more and more powerfully. It was a 
huge effort now to close down the visions that were 
forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he 
would have to resist only a little longer. He would 
yield very soon, because he needed to know that his 
Page | 564 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




theory was right. He must make only one more short 
effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione. 

“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,” 
he said. “I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. 
When he tracked him down, he found that 
Gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore: It was stolen 
from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out 
that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know — but if 
Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, 
it can’t have been that difficult.” 

Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could 
see him standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing 
in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer. 

“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become 
powerful. And at the height of his power, when 
Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could 
stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and 
he took the Elder Wand.” 

“Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron. “But 
then — where is it now?” 

“At Hogwarts,” said Harry, fighting to remain with 
them in the cliff-top garden. 

“But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently. “Harry, let’s go 
and get it before he does!” 

“It’s too late for that,” said Harry. He could not help 
himself, but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. 
“He knows where it is. He’s there now.” 

“Harry!” Ron said furiously. “How long have you 
known this — why have we been wasting time? Why 
did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone — 
we could still go — ” 

Page | 565 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the 
grass. “Hermione’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me 
to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted me 
to get the Horcruxes.” 

“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron. 

“I’m not supposed to ... I’m supposed to get the 
Horcruxes. ...” 

And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was 
barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside 
Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake. 

“I shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his 
high, cold voice. “Leave me now.” 

Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black 
cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked slowly, 
waiting for Snape ’s figure to disappear. It would not 
do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he 
was going. But there were no lights in the castle 
windows, and he could conceal himself ... and in a 
second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment 
Charm that hid him even from his own eyes. 

And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking 
in the outlines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, 
his birthright. ... 

And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark 
waters. The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot 
on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of 
controlled euphoria, that heady sense of purpose in 
destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How fitting 
that this would be its last great act. 



Page | 566 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded 
figure was as long and thin as it had been in life. He 
raised the wand again. 

The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, 
pale, sunken, yet almost perfectly preserved. They 
had left his spectacles on the crooked nose: He felt 
amused derision. Dumbledore’s hands were folded 
upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath 
them, buried with him. 

Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would 
protect the wand? Had he thought that the Dark Lord 
would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike 
hand swooped and pulled the wand from 
Dumbledore’s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of 
sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of 
its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last.

SHELL COTTAGE 

Bill and Fleur’s cottage stood alone on a cliff 
overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells 
and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. 
Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its 
garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of 
the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering 
creature. He spent much of the next few days making 
excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the 
cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and 
the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. 

The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to 
the wand still scared Harry. He could not remember, 
ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, 
doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they 
were together. 

“What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the 
symbol in time to get the wand?” “What if working out 
what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the 
Hallows?” “Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, 
how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know- 

P a g e | 568 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Who?” Harry had no answers: There were moments 
when he wondered whether it had been outright 
madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking 
open the tomb. He could not even explain 
satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every 
time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments 
that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to 
him. 

The odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him 
feel just as confused as Ron’s doubts. Now forced to 
accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained 
that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort 
had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be 
considered. 

“You could never have done that, Harry,” she said 
again and again. “You couldn’t have broken into 
Dumbledore’s grave.” 

But the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry 
much less than the possibility that he might have 
misunderstood the living Dumbledore’s intentions. He 
felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had 
chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering 
whether he had misread the signs, whether he should 
not have taken the other way. From time to time, 
anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, 
powerful as the waves slamming themselves against 
the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore 
had not explained before he died. 

“But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had 
arrived at the cottage. Harry had been staring out 
over the wall that separated the cottage garden from 
the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he 
wished they had not, having no wish to join in with 
their argument. 



Page | 569 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, he is, Ron, please don’t start that again!” 

“Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking 
across Harry, who continued to gaze at the horizon. 
“The silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the 
mirror — ” 

“Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don’t 
you, Harry?” 

“I could have,” said Harry without looking at her. 

“But you don’t think you did, do you?” asked Ron. 

“No, I don’t,” said Harry. 

“There you go!” said Ron quickly, before Hermione 
could carry on. “If it wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how 
Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?” 

“I can’t — but can you explain how Dumbledore sent 
him to us if he’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?” 

“I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!” 

“Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said 
Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he was sure 
of now, but he knew that much. “He would have gone 
on.” 

“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked Ron, but before 
Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, “ 
’Arry?” 

Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair 
flying in the breeze. 



Page | 570 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ ’Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you. ’E eez in 
ze smallest bedroom, ’e says ’e does not want to be 
over’eard.” 

Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver 
messages was clear; she looked irritable as she 
walked back around the house. 

Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in 
the tiniest of the cottage’s three bedrooms, in which 
Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the 
red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, 
which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest 
of the airy, light cottage. 

“I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,” said the 
goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, 
drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. “Though 
the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base 
treachery, I have decided to help you — ” 

“That’s great!” said Harry, relief surging through him. 
“Griphook, thank you, we’re really — ” 

“ — in return,” said the goblin firmly, “for payment.” 

Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. 

“How much do you want? I’ve got gold.” 

“Not gold,” said Griphook. “I have gold.” 

His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his 
eyes. 

“I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.” 
Harry’s spirits plummeted. 



Page | 571 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You can’t have that,” he said. “I’m sorry.” 

“Then,” said the goblin softly, “we have a problem.” 

“We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. 
“I’ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can 
take your pick once we get into the vault.” 

He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed 
angrily. 

“I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure 
treasures to which I have no right!” 

“The sword’s ours — ” 

“It is not,” said the goblin. 

“We’re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor’s — ” 

“And before it was Gryffindor’s, whose was it?” 
demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. 

“No one’s,” said Ron. “It was made for him, wasn’t it?” 

“No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he 
pointed a long finger at Ron. “Wizarding arrogance 
again! That sword was Ragnuk the First’s, taken from 
him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure, a 
masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the 
goblins! The sword is the price of my hire, take it or 
leave it!” 

Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other 
two, then said, “We need to discuss this, Griphook, if 
that’s all right. Could you give us a few minutes?” 

The goblin nodded, looking sour. 



Page | 572 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked 
to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what 
to do. Behind him, Ron said, “He’s having a laugh. We 
can’t let him have that sword.” 

“It is true?” Harry asked Hermione. “Was the sword 
stolen by Gryffindor?” 

“I don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “Wizarding history 
often skates over what the wizards have done to other 
magical races, but there’s no account that I know of 
that says Gryffindor stole the sword.” 

“It’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said Ron, “about 
how the wizards are always trying to get one over on 
them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he 
hasn’t asked for one of our wands.” 

“Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, 

Ron,” said Hermione. “They’ve been treated brutally in 
the past.” 

“Goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, 
are they?” said Ron. “They’ve killed plenty of us. 
They’ve fought dirty too.” 

“But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most 
underhanded and violent isn’t going to make him 
more likely to help us, is it?” 

There was a pause while they tried to think of a way 
around the problem. Harry looked out of the window 
at Dobby’s grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in 
a jam jar beside the headstone. 

“Okay,” said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, 
“how’s this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until 
we get inside the vault, and then he can have it. 



Page | 573 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There’s a fake in there, isn’t there? We switch them, 
and give him the fake.” 

“Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would!” 
said Hermione. “He’s the only one who realized there 
had been a swap!” 

“Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes — ” 

He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving 
him. 

“That,” she said quietly, “is despicable. Ask for his 
help, then double-cross him? And you wonder why 
goblins don’t like wizards, Ron?” 

Ron’s ears had turned red. 

“All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think 
of! What’s your solution, then?” 

“We need to offer him something else, something just 
as valuable.” 

“Brilliant. I’ll go and get one of our other ancient 
goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.” 

Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that 
the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even 
if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the 
sword was their one, indispensable weapon against 
the Horcruxes. 

He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened 
to the rush of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might 
have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had 
always been proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had 
been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who 
had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin. ... 
Page | 574 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Maybe he’s lying,” Harry said, opening his eyes 
again. “Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn’t take the 
sword. How do we know the goblin version of history’s 
right?” 

“Does it make a difference?” asked Hermione. 
“Changes how I feel about it,” said Harry. 

He took a deep breath. 

“Well tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped 
us get into that vault — but we’ll be careful to avoid 
telling him exactly when he can have it.” 

A grin spread slowly across Ron’s face. Hermione, 
however, looked alarmed. 

“Harry, we can’t — ” 

“He can have it,” Harry went on, “after we’ve used it 
on all of the Horcruxes. I’ll make sure he gets it then. 
I’ll keep my word.” 

“But that could be years!” said Hermione. 

“I know that, but he needn’t. I won’t be lying ... 
really.” 

Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and 
shame. He remembered the words that had been 
engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: FOR THE 
GREATER GOOD. He pushed the idea away. What 
choice did they have? 

“I don’t like it,” said Hermione. 

“Nor do I, much,” Harry admitted. 



Page | 575 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I think it’s genius,” said Ron, standing up 
again. “Let’s go and tell him.” 



Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, 
careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time 
for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at 
the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at 
her, afraid that she might give the game away. 
However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. 

“I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me 
the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

“Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand. 

Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those 
black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then 
Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands 
together, and said, “So. We begin!” 

It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over 
again. They settled to work in the smallest bedroom, 
which was kept, according to Griphook’s preference, 
in semidarkness. 

“I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once,” 
Griphook told them, “on the occasion I was told to 
place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most 
ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store 
their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults 
are largest and best protected. ...” 

They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for 
hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched into weeks. 
There was problem after problem to overcome, not 
least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion 
was greatly depleted. 

Page | 576 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“There’s really only enough left for one of us,” said 
Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion against the 
lamplight. 

“That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining 
Griphook’s hand-drawn map of the deepest 
passageways. 

The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly 
fail to notice that something was going on now that 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione only emerged for 
mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry 
often felt Bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table, 
thoughtful, concerned. 

The longer they spent together, the more Harry 
realized that he did not much like the goblin. 
Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at 
the idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed to 
relish the possibility that they might have to hurt 
other wizards to reach the Lestranges’ vault. Harry 
could tell that his distaste was shared by the other 
two, but they did not discuss it: They needed 
Griphook. 

The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. 
Even after his legs had mended, he continued to 
request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail 
Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst 
from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the 
arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook 
joined them at the overcrowded table, although he 
refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on 
lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. 

Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had 
insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so 
that he could question him; his fault that the whole 



Page | 577 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, 
Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. 

“I’m sorry,” he told Fleur, one blustery April evening 
as he helped her prepare dinner. “I never meant you 
to have to deal with all of this.” 

She had just set some knives to work, chopping up 
steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his 
meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by 
Greyback. While the knives sliced away behind her, 
her somewhat irritable expression softened. 

“ ’Arry, you saved my sister’s life, I do not forget.” 

This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry 
decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had 
never been in real danger. 

“Anyway,” Fleur went on, pointing her wand at a pot 
of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, 
“Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel’s zis evening. Zat will 
make zings easier. Ze goblin,” she scowled a little at 
the mention of him, “can move downstairs, and you, 
Ron, and Dean can take zat room.” 

“We don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said 
Harry, who knew that Griphook would think poorly of 
having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy 
was essential to their plans. “Don’t worry about us.” 
And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll be off 
your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won’t 
need to be here much longer.” 

“But what do you mean?” she said, frowning at him, 
her wand pointing at the casserole dish now 
suspended in midair. “Of course you must not leave, 
you are safe ’ere!” 



Page | 578 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, 
and he was glad that the back door opened at that 
moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp 
from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood. 

"... and tiny little ears,” Luna was saying, “a bit like a 
hippo’s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if 
you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a 
waltz, nothing too fast. ...” 

Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as 
he passed, following Luna into the combined dining 
and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were 
laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance to escape 
Fleur’s questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin 
juice and followed them. 

"... and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to 
show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I 
haven’t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me 
from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for 
Christmas,” Luna was saying, as she and Dean relaid 
the fire. 

“Luna, we told you,” Hermione called over to her. 
“That horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not 
a Crumple-Horned Snorkack — ” 

“No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,” said Luna 
serenely. “Daddy told me. It will probably have re- 
formed by now, they mend themselves, you know.” 

Hermione shook her head and continued laying down 
forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down 
the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally 
frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as the latter 
supported him, carrying a large suitcase. 



Page | 579 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,” said Luna, 
approaching the old man. 

“And I you, my dear,” said Ollivander, patting her on 
the shoulder. “You were an inexpressible comfort to 
me in that terrible place.” 

“So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,” said Fleur, kissing him 
on both cheeks. “And I wonder whezzer you could 
oblige me by delivering a package to Bill’s Auntie 
Muriel? I never returned ’er tiara.” 

“It will be an honor,” said Ollivander with a little bow, 
“the very least I can do in return for your generous 
hospitality.” 

Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened 
to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and 
twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. 

“Moonstones and diamonds,” said Griphook, who had 
sidled into the room without Harry noticing. “Made by 
goblins, I think?” 

“And paid for by wizards,” said Bill quietly, and the 
goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and 
challenging. 

A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as 
Bill and Ollivander set off into the night. The rest of 
them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow 
and with barely enough room to move, they started to 
eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside 
them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with 
her food; she glanced at the window every few 
minutes; however, Bill returned before they had 
finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the 
wind.

“Everything’s fine,” he told Fleur. “Ollivander settled 
in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her 
love. Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, 
they’re still operating an Owl-Order business out of 
her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara 
back, though. She said she thought we’d stolen it.” 

“Ah, she eez charmante, your aunt,” said Fleur 
crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty plates 
to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them 
and marched out of the room. 

“Daddy’s made a tiara,” piped up Luna. “Well, more of 
a crown, really.” 

Ron caught Harry’s eye and grinned; Harry knew that 
he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they 
had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. 

“Yes, he’s trying to re-create the lost diadem of 
Ravenclaw. He thinks he’s identified most of the main 
elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made 
a difference — ” 

There was a bang on the front door. Everyone’s head 
turned toward it. Fleur came running out of the 
kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feet, 
his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped 
beneath the table, out of sight. 

“Who is it?” Bill called. 

“It is I, Remus John Lupin!” called a voice over the 
howling wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what 
had happened? “I am a werewolf, married to 
Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of 
Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come 
in an emergency!” 

Page | 581 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Lupin,” muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and 
wrenched it open. 

Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, 
wrapped in a traveling cloak, his graying hair 
windswept. He straightened up, looked around the 
room, making sure of who was there, then cried 
aloud, “It’s a boy! We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s 
father!” 

Hermione shrieked. 

“Wha — ? Tonks — Tonks has had the baby?” 

“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin. All 
around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: 
Hermione and Fleur both squealed, 

“Congratulations!” and Ron said, “Blimey, a baby!” as 
if he had never heard of such a thing before. 

“Yes — yes — a boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed 
dazed by his own happiness. He strode around the 
table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of 
Grimmauld Place might never have happened. 

“You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry. 

“M-me?” stammered Harry 

“You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one 
better — ” 

“I — yeah — blimey — ” 

Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now 
Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was 
persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. 



Page | 582 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin, 
beaming around at them all: He looked years younger 
than Harry had ever seen him. “Thank you, thank 
you, Bill.” 

Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and 
raised them high in a toast. 

“To Teddy Remus Lupin,” said Lupin, “a great wizard 
in the making!” 

“ ’Oo does ’e look like?” Fleur inquired. 

“I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like 
me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was 
born, but I swear it’s turned ginger in the hour since. 
Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda 
says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day that 
she was born.” He drained his goblet. “Oh, go on 
then, just one more,” he added, beaming, as Bill made 
to fill it again. 

The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt 
and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another 
bottle of wine. Lupin’s news seemed to have taken 
them out of themselves, removed them for a while 
from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were 
exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by 
the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he 
slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. 
Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed 
this, until he saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up 
the stairs. 

“No ... no ... I really must get back,” said Lupin at 
last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He got to his 
feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around 
himself. 



Page | 583 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Good-bye, good-bye — I’ll try and bring some 
pictures in a few days’ time — they’ll all be so glad to 
know that I’ve seen you — ” 



He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, 
hugging the women and grasping hands with the 
men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. 

“Godfather, Harry!” said Bill as they walked into the 
kitchen together, helping clear the table. “A real 
honor! Congratulations!” 

As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, 
Bill pulled the door behind him closed, shutting out 
the still-voluble voices of the others, who were 
continuing to celebrate even in Lupin’s absence. 

“I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t 
been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this 
full of people.” 

Bill hesitated. 

“Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.” 

It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not 
bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting. 

“I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts 
ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be 
friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin 
friends — or, at least, goblins I know well, and like.” 
Again, Bill hesitated. 

“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what 
have you promised him in return?” 

“I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.” 

Page | 584 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was 
trying to bring through more empty goblets. 



“Wait,” Bill told her. “Just a moment.” 

She backed out and he closed the door again. 

“Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have 
struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most 
particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you 
must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of 
ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same 
as human ones.” 

Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a 
small snake had stirred inside him. 

“What do you mean?” he asked. 

“We are talking about a different breed of being,” said 
Bill. “Dealings between wizards and goblins have been 
fraught for centuries — but you’ll know all that from 
History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I 
would never claim that wizards have been innocent. 
However, there is a belief among some goblins, and 
those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that 
wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and 
treasure, that they have no respect for goblin 
ownership.” 

“I respect — ” Harry began, but Bill shook his head. 

“You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could 
understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a 
goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is 
the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made objects 
are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.” 

“But if it was bought — ” 

Page | 585 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ — then they would consider it rented by the one who 
had paid the money. They have, however, great 
difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing 
from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook’s face when 
the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I 
believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it 
ought to have been returned to the goblins once the 
original purchaser died. They consider our habit of 
keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from 
wizard to wizard without further payment, little more 
than theft.” 

Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered 
whether Bill guessed more than he was letting on. 

“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the 
door back into the sitting room, “is to be very careful 
what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less 
dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a 
promise to a goblin.” 

“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. 
Thanks. I’ll bear that in mind.” 

As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought 
came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had 
drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as 
reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black 
had been to him. 



Page | 586 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 







GRINGOTTS 

Their plans were made, their preparations complete; 
in the smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black 
hair (plucked from the sweater Hermione had been 
wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass 
phial on the mantelpiece. 

“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said Harry, 
nodding toward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll 
be pretty convincing.” 

Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting 
or bite her as she picked it up. 

“I hate this thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really 
hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn’t work properly for 
me. ... It’s like a bit of her.” 

Harry could not help but remember how Hermione 
had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, 
insisting that he was imagining things when it did not 
work as well as his own, telling him to simply 
practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back 

Page | 587 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault on 
Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize 
her. 

“It’ll probably help you get in character, though,” said 
Ron. “Think what that wand’s done!” 

“But that’s my point!” said Hermione. “This is the 
wand that tortured Neville’s mum and dad, and who 
knows how many other people? This is the wand that 
killed Sirius!” 

Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the 
wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to 
slice it in half with Gryffindor’s sword, which was 
propped against the wall beside him. 

“I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish 
Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too.” 

Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that 
morning. She was out on the back lawn at that 
moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon 
sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers, 
was watching rather gloomily. 

Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had 
once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been 
surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for 
him at least as well as Hermione ’s had done. 
Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the 
secret workings of wands, Harry thought he knew 
what Hermione ’s problem was: She had not won the 
walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it personally from 
Bellatrix. 

The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook 
entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the 
sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his 

Page | 588 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




action at once: He could tell that the goblin had 
noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he 
said, “We’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, 
Griphook. We’ve told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving 
tomorrow, and we’ve told them not to get up to see us 
off.” 

They had been firm on this point, because Hermione 
would need to transform into Bellatrix before they left, 
and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected 
about what they were about to do, the better. They 
had also explained that they would not be returning. 
As they had lost Perkins’s old tent on the night that 
the Snatchers caught them, Bill had lent them 
another one. It was now packed inside the beaded 
bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione 
had protected from the Snatchers by the simple 
expedient of stuffing it down her sock. 

Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, 
not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed 
over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to 
escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was 
tired of trying to make sure that they were not 
overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark 
bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. 
However, precisely how and when they were to part 
from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor’s 
sword remained a question to which Harry had no 
answer. It had been impossible to decide how they 
were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more 
than five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother 
lessons,” growled Ron, as the goblin’s long fingers 
kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill’s 
warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting 
that Griphook was on the watch for possible 
skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily of the 
planned double-cross that Harry had given up 
Page | 589 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it; 
Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to 
snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up 
with nothing better than “Well just have to wing it, 
mate.” 

Harry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early 
hours, he thought back to the way he had felt the 
night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic 
and remembered a determination, almost an 
excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety, 
nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it 
was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that 
their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they 
were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the 
difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he 
felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was 
sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing 
the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak. 

It was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could 
slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in the 
semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where 
they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn 
was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was 
May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering 
palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing 
backward and forward against the cliff: He was going 
to miss the sound. 

Small green shoots were forcing their way up through 
the red earth of Dobby’s grave now; in a year’s time 
the mound would be covered in flowers. The white 
stone that bore the elf’s name had already acquired a 
weathered look. He realized now that they could 
hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful 
place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of 
leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he 
wondered yet again how the elf had known where to 
Page | 590 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




come to rescue them. His fingers moved 
absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around 
his neck, through which he could feel the jagged 
mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had 
seen Dumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door 
opening made him look around. 

Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn 
toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As she 
walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into 
the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they 
had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry 
knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he 
could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller 
than he was, her long black hair rippling down her 
back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested 
upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard 
Hermione through Bellatrix’s low voice. 

“She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, 
Ron, come here so I can do you. ...” 

“Right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long 



“Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking 
handsome — ” “It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I 
liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you 
did last time.” 

Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under 
her breath as she transformed various aspects of 
Ron’s appearance. He was to be given a completely 
fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent 
aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile 
Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the 
Invisibility Cloak. 

“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?” 

Page | 591 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, 
but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so 
well. Ron’s hair was now long and wavy; he had a 
thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a 
short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows. 

“Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry. 

“Shall we go, then?” 

All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying 
dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned 
and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the 
boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm stopped 
working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once 
past the gate, Griphook spoke. 

“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?” 

Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his 
back, his hands linked in front of Harry’s throat. He 
was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the 
goblin and the surprising strength with which he 
clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of 
the beaded bag and threw it over them both. 

“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s 
feet. “I can’t see a thing. Let’s go.” 

Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his 
shoulders, concentrating with all his might on the 
Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to 
Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter as they 
moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds 
later Harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his 
eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past 
wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, 
quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence. 



Page | 592 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. 
Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, was 
polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of 
warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far 
corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the 
shadows. 

“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as 
Hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently. 

“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept 
past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the 
Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised. 

“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as 
they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard. 
“You need to treat people like they’re scum!” 

“Okay, okay!” 

Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a 
brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. At once 
the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared 
in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, 
finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled 
street that was Diagon Alley. 

It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and 
there were hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, 
cobbled street was much altered now from the 
bustling place Harry had visited before his first term 
at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than 
ever were boarded up, though several new 
establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been 
created since his last visit. Harry’s own face glared 
down at him from posters plastered over many 
windows, always captioned with the words 
UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE. 



Page | 593 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. 
He heard them moaning to the few passersby, 
pleading for gold, insisting that they were really 
wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye. 

As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed 
Hermione. They seemed to melt away before her, 
drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as 
they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, 
until the man with the bloodied bandage came 
staggering right across her path. 

“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice 
was cracked, high-pitched; he sounded distraught. 
“Where are my children? What has he done with 
them? You know, you know\” 

“I — I really — ” stammered Hermione. 

The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, 
with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown 
backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood 
there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock 
visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the 
windows on either side of the street, while a little knot 
of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes 
about them and broke into gentle trots, keen to 
vacate the scene. 

Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have 
been more conspicuous; for a moment Harry 
wondered whether it might not be better to leave now 
and try to think of a different plan. Before they could 
move or consult one another, however, they heard a 
cry from behind them. 

“Why, Madam Lestrange!” 



Page | 594 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his 
hold around Harry’s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a 
crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was 
striding toward them. 

“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but 
at that moment Harry could not think who Travers 
was. Hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest 
height and said with as much contempt as she could 
muster: 

“And what do you want?” 

Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted. 

“ He’s another Death Eater\” breathed Griphook, and 
Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into 
Hermione ’s ear. 

“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, 
“but if my presence is not welcome ...” 

Harry recognized his voice now; Travers was one of 
the Death Eaters who had been summoned to 
Xenophilius’s house. 

“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly, 
trying to cover up her mistake. “How are you?” 

“Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and 
about, Bellatrix.” 

“Really? Why?” asked Hermione. 

“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants 
of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house, after the 
... ah ... escape.” 



Page | 595 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was 
true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in 
public — 

“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him 
most faithfully in the past,” said Hermione in a 
magnificent imitation of Bellatrix’s most 
contemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as 
good with him as mine is, Travers.” 

Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also 
seemed less suspicious. He glanced down at the man 
Ron had just Stunned. 

“How did it offend you?” 

“It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said 
Hermione coolly. 

“Some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said 
Travers. “While they do nothing but beg I have no 
objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead 
her case at the Ministry last week. ‘I’m a witch, sir, I’m 
a witch, let me prove it to youV ” he said in a squeaky 
impersonation. “As if I was going to give her my wand 
— but whose wand,” said Travers curiously, “are you 
using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own 
was — ” 

“I have my wand here,” said Hermione coldly, holding 
up Bellatrix’s wand. “I don’t know what rumors you 
have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly 
misinformed.” 

Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he 
turned instead to Ron. 

“Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.” 



Page | 596 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“This is Dragomir Despard,” said Hermione; they had 
decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover 
for Ron to assume. “He speaks very little English, but 
he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord’s aims. He has 
traveled here from Transylvania to see our new 
regime.” 

“Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?” 

“ ’Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand. 

Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron’s hand 
as though frightened of dirtying himself. 

“So what brings you and your — ah — sympathetic 
friend to Diagon Alley this early?” asked Travers. 

“I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione. 

“Alas, I also,” said Travers. “Gold, filthy gold! We 
cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the 
necessity of consorting with our long-fingered 
friends.” 

Harry felt Griphook’s clasped hands tighten 
momentarily around his neck. 

“Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. 

Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside 
him and head along the crooked, cobbled street 
toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts 
stood towering over the other little shops. Ron sloped 
along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed. 

A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they 
needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers 
marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side, 
there was no means for Harry to communicate with 

Page | 597 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot 
of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze 
doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the 
liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had 
been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were 
clutching long thin golden rods. 

“Ah, Probity Probes,” sighed Travers theatrically, “so 
crude — but effective!” 

And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to 
the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed 
them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, 
detected spells of concealment and hidden magical 
objects. Knowing that he had only seconds; Harry 
pointed Draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn 
and murmured, “Confundo” twice. Unnoticed by 
Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at 
the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as 
the spells hit them. 

Hermione ’s long black hair rippled behind her as she 
climbed the steps. 

“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his 
Probe. 

“But you’ve just done that!” said Hermione in 
Bellatrix’s commanding, arrogant voice. Travers 
looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was 
confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe 
and then at his companion, who said in a slightly 
dazed voice, 

“Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.” 

Hermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and 
Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. Harry 



Page | 598 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




glanced back as they crossed the threshold: The 
wizards were both scratching their heads. 

Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were 
made of silver and which carried the poem warning of 
dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up 
at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came 
to him: standing on this very spot on the day that he 
had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his 
life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “ Like I 
said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had 
seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted 
repository of a trove of gold he had never known he 
possessed, and never for an instant could he have 
dreamed that he would return to steal. ... But within 
seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of 
the bank. 

The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on 
high stools, serving the first customers of the day. 
Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old 
goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through 
an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead 
of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall 
to Ron. 

The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said 
to nobody in particular, “Leprechaun,” and then 
greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, 
which was examined and given back to him. 

Hermione stepped forward. 

“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently 
startled. “Dear me! How — how may I help you 
today?” 

“I wish to enter my vault,” said Hermione.

The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced 
around. Not only was Travers hanging back, 
watching, but several other goblins had looked up 
from their work to stare at Hermione. 

“You have ... identification?” asked the goblin. 

“Identification? I — I have never been asked for 
identification before!” said Hermione. 

“ They know\” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear. 
“They must have been warned there might be an 
impostor !” 

“Your wand will do, madam,” said the goblin. He held 
out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast 
of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts 
were aware that Bellatrix’s wand had been stolen. 

“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s 
ear, “the Imperius Cursel” 

Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, 
pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the 
first time in his life, “Imperiol” 

A curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling 
of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, 
down the sinews and veins connecting him to the 
wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took 
Bellatrix’s wand, examined it closely, and then said, 
“Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam 
Lestrange!” 

“What?” said Hermione. “No, no, that’s mine — ” 

“A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter 
again; still the goblins all around were watching. “But 



Page | 600 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




how could you have done, which wandmaker did you 
use?” 

Harry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at 
Travers, he muttered, “Imperiol” once more. 

“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at 
Bellatrix’s wand, “yes, very handsome. And is it 
working well? I always think wands require a little 
breaking in, don’t you?” 

Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s 
enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of 
events without comment. 

The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands 
and a younger goblin approached. 

“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who 
dashed away and returned a moment later with a 
leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, 
which he handed to his senior. “Good, good! So, if you 
will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin, 
hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, 

“I shall take you to your vault.” 

He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging 
happily toward them, the contents of the leather bag 
still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with 
his mouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing 
attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding 
Travers with confusion. 

“Wait — Bogrod!” 

Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. 



Page | 601 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We have instructions,” he said with a bow to 
Hermione. “Forgive me, Madam, but there have been 
special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.” 

He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the 
Imperiused goblin shook him off. 

“I am aware of the instructions. Madam Lestrange 
wishes to visit her vault. ... Very old family ... old 
clients ... This way, please ...” 

And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many 
doors leading off the hall. Harry looked back at 
Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking 
abnormally vacant, and made his decision: With a 
flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, 
walking meekly in their wake as they reached the 
door and passed into the rough stone passageway 
beyond, which was lit with flaming torches. 

“We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the 
door slammed behind them and he pulled off the 
Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his 
shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the 
slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry 
Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,” he added, 
in response to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries 
about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now 
standing there looking blank. “I don’t think I did it 
strongly enough, I don’t know. ...” 

And another memory darted through his mind, of the 
real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had 
first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: “You need to 
mean them, Potter!” 

“What do we do?” asked Ron. “Shall we get out now, 
while we can?” 



Page | 602 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“If we can,” said Hermione, looking back toward the 
door into the main hall, beyond which who knew 
what was happening. 

“We’ve got this far, I say we go on,” said Harry. 

“Good!” said Griphook. “So, we need Bogrod to control 
the cart; I no longer have the authority. But there will 
not be room for the wizard.” 

Harry pointed his wand at Travers. 

“Imperio\” 

The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at 
a smart pace. 

“What are you making him do?” 

“Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, 
who whistled to summon a little cart that came 
trundling along the tracks toward them out of the 
darkness. Harry was sure he could hear shouting 
behind them in the main hall as they all clambered 
into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione crammed together in the back. 

With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They 
hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack 
in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning 
through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward 
all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the 
rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind 
him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever 
deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. 

They might as well have left enormous footprints 
behind them; the more he thought about it, the more 
foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as 



Page | 603 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand, 
when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it — 

They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated 
within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed 
and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a 
waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard 
Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking: They 
zoomed through it. Water filled Harry’s eyes and 
mouth: He could not see or breathe: Then, with an 
awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all 
thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into 
pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione 
shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward 
the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly 
on the rocky passage floor. 

“C-Cushioning Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron 
pulled her to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw 
that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood 
there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely 
herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. 

They were realizing it as they looked at each other, 
feeling their own faces. 

“The Thief’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to 
his feet and looking back at the deluge onto the 
tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than 
water. “It washes away all enchantment, all magical 
concealment! They know there are impostors in 
Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us!” 

Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the 
beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own hand under 
his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility 
Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his 
head in bewilderment: The Thief’s Downfall seemed to 
have lifted the Imperius Curse. 



Page | 604 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We need him,” said Griphook, “we cannot enter the 
vault without a Gringotts goblin. And we need the 
Clankers!” 

“Imperiol” Harry said again; his voice echoed through 
the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady 
control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod 
submitted once more to his will, his befuddled 
expression changing to one of polite indifference, as 
Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools. 

“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said 
Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the 
waterfall and cried, “Protego\” They saw the Shield 
Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up 
the passageway. 

“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way, 

Griphook!” 

“How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as 
they hurried on foot into the darkness after the 
goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. 

“Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry. 
He was trying to listen: He thought he could hear 
something clanking and moving around nearby. 
“Griphook, how much farther?” 

“Not far, Harry Potter, not far ...” 

And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which 
Harry had been prepared, but which still brought all 
of them to a halt. 

A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front 
of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest 
vaults in the place. The beast’s scales had turned pale 
and flaky during its long incarceration under the 

Page | 605 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




ground; its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore 
heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs 
driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked 
wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the 
chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its 
ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that 
made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a 
jet of fire that sent them running back up the 
passageway. 

“It is partially blind,” panted Griphook, “but even 
more savage for that. However, we have the means to 
control it. It has learned what to expect when the 
Clankers come. Give them to me.” 

Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin 
pulled out a number of small metal instruments that 
when shaken made a loud, ringing noise like 
miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them 
out: Bogrod accepted his meekly. 

“You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione. “It will expect pain when it hears the 
noise: It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm 
upon the door of the vault.” 

They advanced around the corner again, shaking the 
Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, 
grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry’s skull 
seemed to vibrate with the din. The dragon let out 
another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see 
it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the 
scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and 
guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords 
when it heard the sound of the Clankers. 

“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook 
urged Harry, who turned his wand again upon 
Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to 

Page | 606 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to 
reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to 
ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, 
the skins of strange creatures — some with long 
spines, others with drooping wings — potions in 
jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. 

“Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside 
the vault. 

He had described Hufflepuff’s cup to Ron and 
Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux 
that resided in this vault, he did not know what it 
looked like. He barely had time to glance around, 
however, before there was a muffled clunk from 
behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them 
inside the vault, and they were plunged into total 
darkness. 

“No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said 
Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise. “Light your 
wands, can’t you? And hurry, we have very little 
time!” 

“Lumosl” 

Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam 
fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of 
Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of 
chains. Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too, 
and were now examining the piles of objects 
surrounding them. 

“Harry, could this be — ? Aargh!” 

Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his 
wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling 
from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower 
of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, 

Page | 607 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every 
direction, the original impossible to discern amongst 
them. 

“It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her 
blistered fingers. 

“They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!” 
said Griphook. “Everything you touch will burn and 
multiply, but the copies are worthless — and if you 
continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually 
be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!” 

“Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately, 
but even as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of 
the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more 
exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot, 
part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot 
metal. 

“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at 
Ron. 

“Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s 
small and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two 
handles — otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw’s 
symbol anywhere, the eagle — ” 

They directed their wands into every nook and 
crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was 
impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry 
sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground 
where they joined the goblets, and now there was 
scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing gold 
blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. 
Harry’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin- 
made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; 
higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly 



Page | 608 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




it found an object that made his heart skip and his 
hand tremble. 



“It’s there, it’s up there\” 

Ron and Hermione pointed their wands at it too, so 
that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way 
spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga 
Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of 
Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by 
Tom Riddle. 

“And how the hell are we going to get up there 
without touching anything?” asked Ron. 

“Accio Cup\” cried Hermione, who had evidently 
forgotten in her desperation what Griphook had told 
them during their planning sessions. 

“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin. 

“Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the 
goblin. “If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll 
have to help us more than — wait! Can I touch stuff 
with the sword? Hermione, give it here!” 

Hermione fumbled inside her robes, drew out the 
beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then 
removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its 
rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver 
flagon nearby, which did not multiply. 

“If I can just poke the sword through a handle — but 
how am I going to get up there?” 

The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach 
for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat 
from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat 
ran down Harry’s face and back as he struggled to 

Page | 609 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the 
dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and 
the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. 

They were truly trapped now: There was no way out 
except through the door, and a horde of goblins 
seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry 
looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their 
faces. 

“Hermione,” said Harry as the clanking grew louder, 
“I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it — ” 

She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and 
whispered, “Levicorpus.” 

Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of 
armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot 
bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of 
pain Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were 
knocked aside into other objects, which also began to 
replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot 
treasure, they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust 
the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff’s cup, 
hooking it onto the blade. 

“Impervius\” screeched Hermione in an attempt to 
protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning 
metal. 

Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: 

Ron and Hermione were waist-deep in treasure, 
struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the 
rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and 
nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in 
view. 

Harry seized Griphook’s fingers and pulled. The 
blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling. 

Page | 610 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Liberacorpus\” yelled Harry, and with a crash he and 
Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling 
treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry’s hand. 

“Get it!” Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot 
metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered onto his 
shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling 
mass of red-hot objects. “Where’s the sword? It had 
the cup on it!” 

The clanking on the other side of the door was 
growing deafening — it was too late — 

“There!” 

It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who 
lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the 
goblin had never expected them to keep their word. 
One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry’s hair, to 
make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of 
burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword 
and swung it high out of Harry’s reach. 

The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the 
sword’s blade, was flung into the air. The goblin still 
astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although 
he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish 
it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from 
his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the 
vault opened up again and he found himself sliding 
uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery 
gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione into 
the outer chamber. 

Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his 
body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating 
treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and 
reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was 
gone. Sliding from Harry’s shoulders the moment he 
Page | 611 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the 
surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and 
crying, “Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!” He vanished 
into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom 
were holding daggers and who accepted him without 
question. 

Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet 
and knew that the only way out was through. 

“Stupefyl” he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined 
in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and 
some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry 
saw several wizard guards running around the 
corner. 

The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of 
flame flew over the goblins: The wizards fled, doubled- 
up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or 
madness, came to Harry. Pointing his wand at the 
thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, 
“Relashiol” 

The cuffs broke open with loud bangs. 

“This way!” Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning 
Spells at the advancing goblins, he sprinted toward 
the blind dragon. 

“Harry — Harry — what are you doing?” cried 
Hermione. 

“Get up, climb up, come on — ” 

The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry’s 
foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled 
himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as 
steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He stretched 
out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron 
Page | 612 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




climbed on behind them, and a second later the 
dragon became aware that it was untethered. 

With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, 
clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales 
as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins 
aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against 
the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, 
while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that 
glanced off its flanks. 

“Well never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed, 
but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame 
again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling 
cracked and crumbled. By sheer force the dragon 
clawed and fought its way through. Harry’s eyes were 
shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the 
crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only 
cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any 
moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, “Defodiol” 

She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, 
carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward 
the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking 
goblins: Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the 
ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed 
the underground lake, and the great crawling, 
snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space 
ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of 
the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of 
rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking 
of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, 
while ahead, the dragon’s fire kept their progress 
clear — 

And then at last, by the combined force of their spells 
and the dragon’s brute strength, they had blasted 
their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. 

Page | 613 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and 
finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: 
Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it 
could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it 
forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them 
buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it 
staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into 
the sky. 



Page | 614 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 





THE FINAL HIDING PLACE 

There was no means of steering; the dragon could not 
see where it was going, and Harry knew that if it 
turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it 
impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, 
as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling 
below them like a gray-and-green map, Harry’s 
overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape 
that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the 
beast’s neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and 
the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and 
blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like 
the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from 
delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at 
the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be 
sobbing. 

After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his 
immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw 
them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting 
as far away from its underground prison as possible; 
but the question of how and when they were to 
dismount remained rather frightening. He had no idea 

Page | 615 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how 
this particular dragon, which could barely see, would 
locate a good place to put down. He glanced around 
constantly, imagining that he could feel his scar 
prickling. ... 

How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they 
had broken into the Lestranges’ vault? How soon 
would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How 
quickly would they realize what had been taken? And 
then, when they discovered that the golden cup was 
missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that they 
were hunting Horcruxes. ... 

The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: It 
climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps 
of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out 
the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and 
out of the capital. On and on they flew, over 
countryside parceled out in patches of green and 
brown, over roads and rivers winding through the 
landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon. 

“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as 
they flew farther and farther north. 

“No idea,” Harry bellowed back. His hands were numb 
with cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip. 
He had been wondering for some time what they 
would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if 
the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and 
numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. 
When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? 
Surely it would need sustenance before long? And 
what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly 
edible humans sitting on its back? 

The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning 
indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and towns 

Page | 616 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous 
shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud. 
Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on 
to the dragon’s back. 

“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a 
considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing 
height?” 

Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains 
and lakes, coppery in the sunset. The landscape 
seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he 
squinted over the side of the dragon, and he 
wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh 
water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. 

Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling 
circles, honing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller 
lakes. 

“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called 
back to the others. “Straight into the water before it 
realizes we’re here!” 

They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry 
could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling 
in the surface of the water. 

“NOW!” 

He slithered over the side of the dragon and 
plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; 
the drop was greater than he had estimated and he 
hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a 
freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward 
the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous 
ripples emanating in circles from the places where 
Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not 
seem to have noticed anything: It was already fifty 
Page | 617 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up 
water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione 
emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of 
the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, 
and landed at last on a distant bank. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite 
shore. The lake did not seem to be deep: Soon it was 
more a question of fighting their way through reeds 
and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, 
sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass. 

Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. 
Though Harry could have happily lain down and 
slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and 
started casting the usual protective spells around 
them. 

When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the 
first time that he had seen them properly since 
escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all 
over their faces and arms, and their clothing was 
singed away in places. They were wincing as they 
dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries. 
Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out 
three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from 
Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. 

They changed and then gulped down the juice. 

“Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was 
sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, “we got 
the Horcrux. On the downside — ” 

“ — no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he 
dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans 
onto the angry burn beneath. 

“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little 
scab ...” 

Page | 618 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet 
jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the 
grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew 
their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice. 

“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit 
weird hanging round our necks,” said Ron, wiping his 
mouth on the back of his hand. 

Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank, 
where the dragon was still drinking. 

“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will 
it be all right?” 

“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It’s a dragon, 
Hermione, it can look after itself. It’s us we need to 
worry about.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Well, I don’t know how to break this to you,” said 
Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke 
into Gringotts.” 

All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it 
was difficult to stop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt 
lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass 
beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his 
throat was raw. 

“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione 
finally, hiccuping herself back to seriousness. “He’ll 
know, won’t he? You- Know- Who will know we know 
about his Horcruxes!” 

“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him?” said Ron 
hopefully. “Maybe they’ll cover up — ” 



Page | 619 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron’s 
voice were extinguished: Pain cleaved Harry’s head 
like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit 
room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on 
the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. 

“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and 
cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. The one 
thing he had dreaded — but it could not be true, he 
could not see how ... 

The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes 
high above his. 

“Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “ Say it again).” 

“M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes 
wide with terror, “m-my Lord ... we t-tried t-to st-stop 
them. ... Im-impostors, my Lord ... broke — broke 
into the — into the Lestranges’ v-vault. ...” 

“Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had 
ways of revealing impostors? Who were they?” 

“It was ... it was . . . the P-Potter b-boy and t-two 
accomplices. ...” 

“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible 
fear gripping him. “Tell me! What did they take?” 

“A ... a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord ...” 

The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a 
stranger’s: He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be 
true, it was impossible, nobody had ever known: How 
was it possible that the boy could have discovered his 
secret? 



Page | 620 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green 
light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin 
rolled over, dead; the watching wizards scattered 
before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy 
threw others behind them in their race for the door, 
and again and again his wand fell, and those who 
were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this 
news, for hearing about the golden cup — 

Alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, 
and they passed before him in vision: his treasures, 
his safeguards, his anchors to immortality — the 
diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, 
what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he 
know, had he already acted, had he traced more of 
them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? 
Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; 
Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose 
wand was his now, yet who reached out from the 
ignominy of death through the boy, the boy — 

But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his 
Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known, 
would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; 
he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore 
and of how many other worthless, nameless men: 
How could Lord Voldemort not have known, if he, 
himself, most important and precious, had been 
attacked, mutilated? 

True, he had not felt it when the diary had been 
destroyed, but he had thought that was because he 
had no body to feel, being less than ghost. ... No, 
surely, the rest were safe. ... The other Horcruxes 
must be intact. ... 

But he must know, he must be sure. ... He paced the 
room, kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed, 



Page | 621 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling 
brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts — 

A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could 
the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the 
Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be 
related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, 
the killings had never been traced to him: The ring, 
surely, was safe. 

And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about 
the cave or penetrate its protection? The idea of the 
locket being stolen was absurd. ... 

As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts 
he had stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had 
plumbed the deepest secrets of that place. ... 

And there was still Nagini, who must remain close 
now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his 
protection. ... 

But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to 
each of his hiding places, he must redouble protection 
around each of his Horcruxes. ... A job, like the quest 
for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone ... 

Which should he visit first, which was in most 
danger? An old unease flickered inside him. 
Dumbledore had known his middle name. ... 
Dumbledore might have made the connection with 
the Gaunts. ... Their abandoned home was, perhaps, 
the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that 
he would go first. ... 

The lake, surely impossible ... though was there a 
slight possibility that Dumbledore might have known 
some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage. 



Page | 622 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




And Hogwarts . . . but he knew that his Horcrux there 
was safe; it would be impossible for Potter to enter 
Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. 
Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to 
the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. ... 
To tell Snape why the boy might return would be 
foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust 
Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn’t their stupidity and 
carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust? 

He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take 
Nagini with him: He would not be parted from the 
snake anymore . . . and he strode from the room, 
through the hall, and out into the dark garden where 
the fountain played; he called the snake in 
Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a 
long shadow. ... 

Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back 
to the present: He was lying on the bank of the lake in 
the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking 
down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by 
the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden 
excursion into Voldemort’s mind had not passed 
unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely 
surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw 
the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and 
the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun. 

“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low 
after Voldemort’s high screams. “He knows, and he’s 
going to check where the others are, and the last 
one,” he was already on his feet, “is at Hogwarts. I 
knew it. I knew it.” 

“What?” 

Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking 
worried. 

Page | 623 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But what did you see? How do you know?” 



“I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his 
head, he’s” — Harry remembered the killings — “he’s 
seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand 
how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others 
are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is 
safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard 
not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one 
last, but he could still be there within hours — ” 

“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, 
now scrambling to his feet too. 

“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he 
didn’t think about exactly where it is — ” 

“Wait, wait\” cried Hermione as Ron caught up the 
Horcrux and Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak 
again. “We can’t just go, we haven’t got a plan, we 
need to — ” 

“We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had 
been hoping to sleep, looking forward to getting into 
the new tent, but that was impossible now. “Can you 
imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the 
ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the 
Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t safe enough?” 

“But how are we going to get in?” 

“Well go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work 
something out once we see what the protection 
around the school’s like. Get under the Cloak, 
Hermione, I want to stick together this time.” 

“But we don’t really fit — ” 

“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.” 

Page | 624 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the 
black water: The dragon had drunk its fill and risen 
into the air. They paused in their preparations to 
watch it climb higher and higher, now black against 
the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a 
nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward 
and took her place between the other two. Harry 
pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and 
together they turned on the spot into the crushing 
darkness. 



Page | 625 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE MISSING MIRROR 

Harry’s feet touched road. He saw the achingly 
familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, 
and the outline of black mountains beyond the 
village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off 
toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows 
of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the 
heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he 
had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a 
desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, 
upon landing — and then, even as he relaxed his grip 
upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened. 

The air was rent by a scream that sounded like 
Voldemort’s when he had realized the cup had been 
stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry’s body, and he 
knew immediately that their appearance had caused 
it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the 
Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open 
and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters 
dashed into the street, their wands aloft. 



Page | 626 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Harry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there 
were too many of them to Stun: Even attempting it 
would give away their position. One of the Death 
Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still 
echoing around the distant mountains. 

“Accio Cloak).” roared one of the Death Eaters. 

Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to 
escape: The Summoning Charm had not worked on it. 

“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the 
Death Eater who had tried the charm, and then to his 
fellows, “Spread out. He’s here.” 

Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the 
nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed 
them by inches. They waited in the darkness, 
listening to the footsteps running up and down, 
beams of light flying along the street from the Death 
Eaters’ searching wands. 

“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate 
now!” 

“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply a 
Death Eater shouted, 

“We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting 
away! We’ll find you!” 

“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set 
up that spell to tell them we’d come. I reckon they’ve 
done something to keep us here, trap us — ” 

“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. 
“Let ’em have free rein, they’d find him quick enough!” 



Page | 627 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his 



“ — an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord 
wants Potter’s life, not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if 
he’s been Kissed first!” 

There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: 

To repel dementors they would have to produce 
Patronuses, which would give them away 
immediately. 

“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” 
Hermione whispered. 

Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to 
steal over the street. Light was sucked from the 
environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In 
the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his 
arm and together, they turned on the spot. 

The air through which they needed to move seemed to 
have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the 
Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold 
was biting deeper and deeper into Harry’s flesh. He, 
Ron, and Hermione retreated down the side street, 
groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a 
sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, 
came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because 
they were of a denser darkness than their 
surroundings, with their black cloaks and their 
scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in 
the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be 
coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, 
rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair on the 
air, closing in — 

He raised his wand: He could not, would not, suffer 
the Dementor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It 

Page | 628 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he 
whispered, “Expecto Patronum).” 

The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The 
dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell 
from somewhere out of sight. 

“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, 
it was a stag! 

The dementors had retreated, the stars were popping 
out again, and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were 
becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could 
decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts 
nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the 
narrow street, and a rough voice said, “Potter, in here, 
quick!” 

He obeyed without hesitation: The three of them 
hurtled through the open doorway. 

“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a 
tall figure, passing them on his way into the street 
and slamming the door behind him. 

Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he 
saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the 
grubby, sawdust- strewn bar of the Hog’s Head Inn. 
They ran behind the counter and through a second 
doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase that 
they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened 
onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a 
small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil 
painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room 
with a kind of vacant sweetness. 

Shouts reached them from the street below. Still 
wearing the Invisibility Cloak, they crept toward the 
grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom 

Page | 629 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry now recognized as the Hog’s Head’s barman, 
was the only person not wearing a hood. 

“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded 
faces. “So what? You send dementors down my street, 
I’ll send a Patronus back at ’em! I’m not having ’em 
near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it!” 

“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater. 

“That was a stag, it was Potter’s!” 

“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. 
“Stag! You idiot — Expecto Patronum .!” 

Something huge and horned erupted from the wand: 
Head down, it charged toward the High Street and out 
of sight. 

“That’s not what I saw — ” said the Death Eater, 
though with less certainty. 

“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of 
his companions told the barman. “Someone was out 
in the street against regulations — ” 

“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to 
your curfew!” 

“ You set off the Caterwauling Charm?” 

“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill 
me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, 
then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you 
haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and 
summoned him. He’s not going to like being called 
here for me and my old cat, is he, now?” 

“Don’t you worry about us,” said one of the Death 
Eaters, “worry about yourself, breaking curfew!” 

Page | 630 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons 
when my pub’s closed down? What’ll happen to your 
little sidelines then?” 



“Are you threatening — ?” 



“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t 
it?” 



“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first 
Death Eater. 

“Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!” 

“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death 
Eater. “Break curfew again and we won’t be so 
lenient!” 

The Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street. 
Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under 
the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. 
Harry drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the 
Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the 
barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, 
then climbing the stairs. 

Harry’s attention was caught by something on the 
mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror propped on 
top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl. 

The barman entered the room. 

“You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to 
the other of them. “What were you thinking, coming 
here?” 

“Thank you,” said Harry. “We can’t thank you 
enough. You saved our lives.” 

Page | 631 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking 
up into the face, trying to see past the long, stringy, 
wire-gray hair and beard. He wore spectacles. Behind 
the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant 
blue. 

“It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.” 

There was silence in the room. Harry and the barman 
looked at each other. 

“You sent Dobby.” 

The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. 

“Thought he’d be with you. Where Ve you left him?” 

“He’s dead,” said Harry. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed 
him.” 

The barman’s face was impassive. After a few 
moments he said, “I’m sorry to hear it. I liked that 
elf.” 

He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his 
wand, not looking at any of them. 

“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back. 

He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light 
the fire. 

“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across 
to Sirius’s mirror, the twin of the one he had broken 
nearly two years before. “Bought it from Dung ’bout a 
year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus told me what it was. 
Been trying to keep an eye out for you.” 

Ron gasped. 

Page | 632 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“The silver doe!” he said excitedly. “Was that you too?” 

“What are you talking about?” said Aberforth. 

“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!” 

“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. 
Haven’t I just proved my Patronus is a goat?” 

“Oh,” said Ron. “Yeah ... well, I’m hungry!” he added 
defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble. 

“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the 
room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of 
bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which 
he set upon a small table in front of the fire. 

Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there 
was silence but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of 
goblets, and the sound of chewing. 

“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten 
their fill, and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in 
their chairs. “We need to think of the best way to get 
you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you heard 
what happens if anyone moves outdoors during 
darkness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off, they’ll be 
onto you like bow-truckles on doxy eggs. I don’t 
reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second 
time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you 
can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get 
right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and 
you’ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. 
He’s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever 
since they tried to arrest him.” 

“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into 
Hogwarts.” 

“Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth. 

Page | 633 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We’ve got to,” said Harry. 



“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning 
forward, “is to get as far from here as you can.” 

“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve 
got to get into the castle. Dumbledore — I mean, your 
brother — wanted us — ” 

The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth ’s 
glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and 
Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, 
Aragog. 

“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said 
Aberforth, “and people had a habit of getting hurt 
while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get 
away from this school, Potter, and out of the country 
if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. 
He’s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you 
don’t owe him anything.” 

“You don’t understand,” said Harry again. 

“Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think 
I understood my own brother? Think you knew Albus 
better than I did?” 

“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt 
sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food 
and wine. “It’s ... he left me a job.” 

“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? 
Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you’d expect an 
unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without 
overstretching themselves?” 

Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking 
strained. 

Page | 634 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I-it’s not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to — ” 

“ ‘Got to’? Why ‘got to*? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said 
Aberforth roughly. “Let it go, boy, before you follow 
him! Save yourself!” 

“I can’t.” 

“Why not?” 

“I — ” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so 
he took the offensive instead. “But you’re fighting too, 
you’re in the Order of the Phoenix — ” 

“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is 
finished. You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone 
who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves. It’ll 
never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too 
badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. 

Best take these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at 
Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be in danger long as they 
live now everyone knows they’ve been working with 
you.” 

“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job — ” 

“Give it to someone else!” 

“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all 



“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was 
he honest with you?” 

Harry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but 
somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips. 
Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. 



Page | 635 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our 
mother’s knee. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew 
up, and Albus ... he was a natural.” 

The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl 
over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked 
around properly, the only picture in the room. There 
was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of 
anyone else. 

“Mr. Dumbledore?” said Hermione rather timidly. “Is 
that your sister? Ariana?” 

“Yes,” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita 
Skeeter, have you, missy?” 

Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that 
Hermione had turned red. 

“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, 
trying to spare Hermione. 

“That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another 
swig of mead. “Thought the sun shone out of my 
brother’s every orifice, he did. Well, so did plenty of 
people, you three included, by the looks of it.” 

Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the 
doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had 
riddled him for months now. He had made his choice 
while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided to 
continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated 
for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had 
not been told everything that he wanted to know, but 
simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he 
did not want to hear anything that would deflect him 
from his purpose. He met Aberforth ’s gaze, which was 
so strikingly like his brother’s: The bright blue eyes 
gave the same impression that they were X-raying the 
Page | 636 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that 
Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised 
him for it. 

“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very 
much,” said Hermione in a low voice. 

“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing, how 
many of the people my brother cared about very 
much ended up in a worse state than if he’d left ’em 
well alone.” 

“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly. 

“Never you mind,” said Aberforth. 

“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said 
Hermione. “Are you — are you talking about your 
sister?” 

Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were 
chewing the words he was holding back. Then he 
burst into speech. 

“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, 
set upon, by three Muggle boys. They’d seen her 
doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: 
She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or 
wizard can at that age. What they saw scared them, I 
expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and 
when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit 
carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.” 

Hermione ’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked 
slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and 
suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his 
pain.

“It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right 
again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get 
rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it 
exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and 
at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly 
she was sweet and scared and harmless. 

“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” 
said Aberforth, “and attacked them. And they locked 
him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d 
done it, because if the Ministry had known what 
Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in St. 
Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious 
threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, 
unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of 
her at moments when she couldn’t keep it in any 
longer. 

“We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, 
put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after 
her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. 

“I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a 
grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through 
Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard. “Not Albus, 
he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, 
reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up 
with his correspondence with ‘the most notable 
magical names of the day,’ ” Aberforth sneered. “He 
didn’t want to be bothered with her. She liked me 
best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for 
my mother, I could get her to calm down when she 
was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she 
used to help me feed the goats. 

“Then, when she was fourteen ... See, I wasn’t there,” 
said Aberforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed 
her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother 
wasn’t as young as she was, and ... it was an 

Page | 638 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother 
was killed.” 

Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he 
did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept 
talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been 
since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he 
had ever spoken about it. 

“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with 
little Doge. The pair of ’em came home for my 
mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, 
and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!” 

Aberforth spat into the fire. 

“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care 
about school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He 
told me I had to finish my education and he’d take 
over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. 
Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your half- 
mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every 
other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till 
he came.” 

And now a positively dangerous look crept over 
Aberforth’s face. 

“Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to 
talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he 
was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, 
while they were hatching all their plans for a new 
Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, and 
whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand 
plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one 
young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when 
Albus was working for the greater good? 



Page | 639 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It 
was nearly time for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I 
told ’em, both of ’em, face-to-face, like I am to you, 
now,” and Aberforth looked down at Harry, and it 
took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry 
and angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told him, 
you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s 
in no fit state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it 
is you’re planning to go, when you’re making your 
clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a 
following. He didn’t like that,” said Aberforth, and his 
eyes were briefly occluded by the firelight on the 
lenses of his glasses: They shone white and blind 
again. “Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got 
angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, 
trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant 
brother. ... Didn’t I understand, my poor sister 
wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the 
world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught 
the Muggles their place? 

“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled out my 
wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus 
Curse used on me by my brother’s best friend — and 
Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us 
were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs 
set her off, she couldn’t stand it — ” 

The color was draining from Aberforth ’s face as 
though he had suffered a mortal wound. 

“ — and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t 
really know what she was doing, and I don’t know 
which of us did it, it could have been any of us — and 
she was dead.” 

His voice broke on the last word and he dropped 
down into the nearest chair. Hermione’s face was wet 
with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. 

Page | 640 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had 
not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of 
it. 

“I’m so ... I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered. 

“Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.” 

He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat. 

“ ’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a 
track record already, back in his own country, and he 
didn’t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus 
was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister, 
free to become the greatest wizard of the — ” 

“He was never free,” said Harry. 

“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth. 

“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, 
he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He 
started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn’t 
there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please ... hurt me instead.’ ” 

Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had 
never gone into details about what had happened on 
the island on the lake: The events that had taken 
place after he and Dumbledore had returned to 
Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly. 

“He thought he was back there with you and 
Grindelwald, I know he did,” said Harry, remembering 
Dumbledore whimpering, pleading. “He thought he 
was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana. . . . 
It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you 
wouldn’t say he was free.” 



Page | 641 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own 
knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said, 
“How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn’t 
more interested in the greater good than in you? How 
can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my 
little sister?” 

A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart. 

“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said 
Hermione. 

“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then?” shot back 
Aberforth. “Why didn’t he say to him, Take care of 
yourself, here’s how to survive’?” 

“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, 
“sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your 
own safety! Sometimes you’ve got to think about the 
greater good! This is war!” 

“You’re seventeen, boy!” 

“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if 
you’ve given up!” 

“Who says I’ve given up?” 

“ The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’ ” Harry 
repeated. “ Tou- Know- Who’s won, it’s over, and 
anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding 
themselves.’ ” 

“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!” 

“No, it isn’t,” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to 
finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge 
on to me. I’m going to keep going until I succeed — or 



Page | 642 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. 
I’ve known it for years.” 



He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did 
not. He merely scowled. 

“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If 
you can’t help us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in 
peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can 
help us — well, now would be a great time to mention 
it.” 

Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry 
with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his 
brother’s. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, 
walked around the little table, and approached the 
portrait of Ariana. 

“You know what to do,” he said. 

She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people 
in portraits usually did, out of the sides of their 
frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel 
painted behind her. They watched her slight figure 
retreating until finally she was swallowed by the 
darkness. 

“Er — what — ?” began Ron. 

“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You 
must know they’ve got all the old secret passageways 
covered at both ends, dementors all around the 
boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from 
what my sources tell me. The place has never been so 
heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once 
you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the 
Carrows as his deputies ... well, that’s your lookout, 
isn’t it? You say you’re prepared to die.” 

Page | 643 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But what ... ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s 
picture. 

A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the 
painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back 
toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. 
But there was somebody else with her now, someone 
taller than she was, who was limping along, looking 
excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen 
it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his 
face and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and 
larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and 
shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing 
swung forward on the wall like a little door, and the 
entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, 
his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, 
clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a 
roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and 
yelled, “I knew you’d come! I knew it, HarryY’ 



Page | 644 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE LOST DIADEM 

“Neville — what the — how — ?” 

But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with 
yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer 
Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One 
of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were 
gouge marks on his face, and his general air of 
unkemptness suggested that he had been living 
rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with 
happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, “I 
knew you’d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter 
of time!” 

“Neville, what’s happened to you?” 

“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a 
shake of the head. “This is nothing. Seamus is worse. 
You’ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,” he turned to 
Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple more people 
on the way.” 



Page | 645 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What 
d’you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a 
curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on the whole 
village!” 

“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into 
the bar,” said Neville. “Just send them down the 
passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.” 

Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her 
to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; 
Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed 
Aberforth. 

“I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our 
lives twice.” 

“Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly. “I might 
not be able to save ’em a third time.” 

Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and 
through the hole behind Ariana’s portrait. There were 
smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked as 
though the passageway had been there for years. 
Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor 
was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows 
rippled, fanlike, across the wall. 

“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set 
off. “It isn’t on the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I 
thought there were only seven passages in and out of 
school?” 

“They sealed off all of those before the start of the 
year,” said Neville. “There’s no chance of getting 
through any of them now, not with curses over the 
entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at 
the exits.” He started walking backward, beaming, 
drinking them in. “Never mind that stuff. ... Is it true? 
Page | 646 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a 
dragon? It’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, 
Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about 
it in the Great Hall at dinner!” 

“Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry. 

Neville laughed gleefully. 

“What did you do with the dragon?” 

“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was 
all for keeping it as a pet — ” 

“Don’t exaggerate, Ron — ” 

“But what have you been doing? People have been 
saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t 
think so. I think you’ve been up to something.” 

“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about 
Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’t heard anything.” 

“It’s been ... well, it’s not really like Hogwarts 
anymore,” said Neville, the smile fading from his face 
as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?” 

“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?” 

“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in 
charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the 
Carrows.” 

“Like Umbridge?” 

“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers 
are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do 
anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can avoid 
it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do. 

Page | 647 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be 
Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it’s just 
the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the 
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions 



“What?” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up 
and down the passage. 

“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he 
pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I 
refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; 
Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been 
top in anything, I expect. 

“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, 
which is compulsory for everyone. We’ve all got to 
listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, 
stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into 
hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the 
natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,” 
he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her 
how much Muggle blood she and her brother have 
got.” 

“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place 
for getting a smart mouth.” 

“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have 
stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people 
stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to 
notice that when you did it, Harry.” 

“But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said 
Ron, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and 
Neville’s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. 



Page | 648 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Neville shrugged. 



“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much 
pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy 
but they won’t actually kill us.” 

Harry did not know what was worse, the things that 
Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which 
he said them. 

“The only people in real danger are the ones whose 
friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. 
They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was 
getting a bit too outspoken in The Quihhler, so they 
dragged Luna off the train on the way back for 
Christmas.” 

“Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her — ” 

“Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.” 

From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry 
recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that 
Dumbledore’s Army had used to send one another 
messages. 

“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at 
Hermione. “The Carrows never rumbled how we were 
communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak 
out at night and put graffiti on the walls: 

Dumbledore’s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. 
Snape hated it.” 

“You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past 
tense. 

“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said 
Neville. “We lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never 
came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort 

Page | 649 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was 
behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me 
hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught 
releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they 
tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.” 

“No kidding,” muttered Ron, as the passage began to 
slope upward. 

“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what 
Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But 
we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right 
up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they 
decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, 
and they went for Gran.” 

“They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
together. 

“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the 
passage was climbing so steeply, “well, you can see 
their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping 
kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was 
only a matter of time before they did it the other way 
around. Thing was,” he faced them, and Harry was 
astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a 
bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old 
witch living alone, they probably thought they didn’t 
need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,” 
Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and 
Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter,” he clapped a 
hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she 
was proud of me, that I’m my parents’ son, and to 
keep it up.” 

“Cool,” said Ron. 

“Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once 
they realized they had no hold over me, they decided 

Page | 650 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don’t know 
whether they were planning to kill me or send me to 
Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.” 

“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t 
— aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?” 

“ ’Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.” 

They turned a corner and there ahead of them was 
the end of the passage. Another short flight of steps 
led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana’s 
portrait. Neville pushed it open and climbed through. 
As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out to unseen 
people: 

“Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?” 

As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, 
there were several screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s 
Potter, it’s POTTER!” “Ron!” “Hermionel” 

He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of 
lamps and many faces. The next moment, he, Ron, 
and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the 
back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what 
seemed to be more than twenty people: They might 
just have won a Quidditch final. 

“Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the 
crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in their 
surroundings. 

He did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous, 
and looked rather like the interior of a particularly 
sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s 
cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the 
ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark 
wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were 
Page | 651 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the 
gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black 
badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the 
bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and 
green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were 
bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped 
against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden- 
cased wireless. 

“Where are we?” 

“Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville. 
“Surpassed itself, hasn’t it? The Carrows were 
chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a 
hideout: I managed to get through the door and this 
is what I found! Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I 
arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one 
hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it’s 
expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.” 

“And the Carrows can’t get in?” asked Harry, looking 
around for the door. 

“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not 
recognized until he spoke: Seamus’s face was bruised 
and puffy. “It’s a proper hideout, as long as one of us 
stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t 
open. It’s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. 
You’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need — like, 

‘I don’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get 
in’ — and it’ll do it for you! You’ve just got to make 
sure you close the loopholes! Neville’s the man!” 

“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville 
modestly. “I’d been in here about a day and a half, 
and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get 
something to eat, and that’s when the passage to the 
Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met 
Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food, because 
Page | 652 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t 
really do.” 



“Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to 
Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron 
to general astonishment. 

“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” 
said Seamus, “and it just makes more hammocks 
every time we need them, and it even sprouted a 
pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up — 



“ — and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” 
supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not 
noticed until that point. Now that he looked around 
properly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both 
Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie 
Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner. 

“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. 
“There’ve been so many rumors, we’ve been trying to 
keep up with you on Potterwatch.” He pointed at the 
wireless. “You didn’t break into Gringotts?” 

“They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!” 

There was a smattering of applause and a few 
whoops; Ron took a bow. 

“What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly. 

Before any of them could parry the question with one 
of their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in 
the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on 
the curious and delighted faces, the Room of 
Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a 
ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were 
ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay 
Page | 653 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort’s 
scream of fury vibrated inside his head. 

With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s 
mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the 
Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face 
and Ron holding him up. 

“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want 
to sit down? I expect you’re tired, aren’t — ?” 

“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, 
trying to tell them without words that Voldemort had 
just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. 
Time was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit 
Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance. 

“We need to get going,” he said, and their expressions 
told him that they understood. 

“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked 
Seamus. “What’s the plan?” 

“Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his 
willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to 
Voldemort’s rage: His scar was still burning. “Well, 
there’s something we — Ron, Hermione, and I — need 
to do, and then we’ll get out of here.” 

Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville 
looked confused. 

“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?” 

“We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing 
his scar, trying to soothe the pain. “There’s something 
important we need to do — ” 

“What is it?” 

Page | 654 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I — I can’t tell you.” 



There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville’s 
brows contracted. 

“Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with 
fighting You-Know-Who, right?” 

“Well, yeah — ” 

“Then we’ll help you.” 

The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were 
nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly. A 
couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate 
their willingness for immediate action. 

“You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said 
that a lot in the last few hours. “We — we can’t tell 
you. We’ve got to do it — alone.” 

“Why?” asked Neville. 

“Because ...” In his desperation to start looking for 
the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private 
discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they 
might commence their search, Harry found it difficult 
to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing. 
“Dumbledore left the three of us a job,” he said 
carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean, 
he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.” 

“We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army. 
We were all in it together, we’ve been keeping it going 
while you three have been off on your own — ” 

“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron. 



Page | 655 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t 
trust us. Everyone in this room’s been fighting and 
they’ve been driven in here because the Carrows were 
hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re 
loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you.” 

“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was 
going to say, but it did not matter: The tunnel door 
had just opened behind him. 

“We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I 
thought you must be here!” 

It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of 
delight and ran to hug his best friend. 

“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be 
back!” 

“Luna,” said Harry distractedly, “what are you doing 
here? How did you — ?” 

“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake 
Galleon. “I promised her and Ginny that if you turned 
up I’d let them know. We all thought that if you came 
back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to 
overthrow Snape and the Carrows.” 

“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly. 
“Isn’t it, Harry? We’re going to fight them out of 
Hogwarts?” 

“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m 
sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. There’s 
something we’ve got to do, and then — ” 

“You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded 
Michael Corner. 



Page | 656 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will benefit 
everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of 
You-Know-Who — ” 



“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be 
a part of it!” 

There was another noise behind them, and Harry 
turned. His heart seemed to fail: Ginny was now 
climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed 
by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a 
radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully 
appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never 
been less pleased to see her. 

“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising 
his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. “He 
wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a railway 
station.” 

Harry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan 
came Harry’s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at 
him. 

“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake 
Galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael 
Corner. 

“So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George. 

“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the 
sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take 
everything in while his scar was still burning so 
fiercely. 

“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My 
favorite kind,” said Fred. 



Page | 657 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did 
you call them all back for? This is insane — ” 

“We’re fighting, aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his 
fake Galleon. “The message said Harry was back, and 
we were going to fight! I’ll have to get a wand, though 



“You haven’t got a wand — ?” began Seamus. 

Ron turned suddenly to Harry. 

“Why can’t they help?” 

“What?” 

“They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so 
that none of them could hear but Hermione, who 
stood between them, “We don’t know where it is. 
We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to tell them it’s 
a Horcrux.” 

Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, 
“I think Ron’s right. We don’t even know what we’re 
looking for, we need them.” And when Harry looked 
unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone, 
Harry.” 

Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head 
threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned 
him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione 
about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s how we 
grew up, and Albus ...he was a natural. ... Was he 
turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets 
clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But 
Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that 
led? To murder at the top of the highest tower ... 



Page | 658 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he 
called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred 
and George, who had been cracking jokes for the 
benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them 
looked alert, excited. 

“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said. 
“Something — something that’ll help us overthrow 
You-Know-Who. It’s here at Hogwarts, but we don’t 
know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. 

Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone 
ever come across something with her eagle on it, for 
instance?” 

He looked hopefully toward the little group of 
Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but 
it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of 
Ginny’s chair. 

“Well, there’s her lost diadem. I told you about it, 
remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? 
Daddy’s trying to duplicate it.” 

“Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner, 
rolling his eyes, “is lost, Luna. That’s sort of the 
point.” 

“When was it lost?” asked Harry. 

“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart 
sank. “Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished 
with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,” she 
appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws, “nobody’s ever 
found a trace of it, have they?” 

They all shook their heads. 

“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron. 



Page | 659 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s 
was supposed to have magical properties, enhance 
the wisdom of the wearer.” 

“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons — ” 

But Harry cut across Luna. 

“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks 
like it?” 

They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron 
and Hermione and his own disappointment was 
mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost 
this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem 
like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the 
castle. ... Before he could formulate a new question, 
however, Cho spoke again. 

“If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to 
look like, I could take you up to our common room 
and show you, Harry? Ravenclaw’s wearing it in her 
statue.” 

Harry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room 
of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead 
the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great 
snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was 
flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, 
to the castle, he did not know: Either way, there was 
hardly any time left. 

“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron and 
Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at them. 
“Listen, I know it’s not much of a lead, but I’m going 
to go and look at this statue, at least find out what 
the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you 
know — the other one — safe.” 



Page | 660 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather 
fiercely, “No, Luna will take Harry, won’t you, Luna?” 

“Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho 
sat down again, looking disappointed. 

“How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville. 

“Over here.” 

He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small 
cupboard opened onto a steep staircase. 

“It comes out somewhere different every day, so 
they’ve never been able to find it,” he said. “Only 
trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re going to 
end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they’re 
always patrolling the corridors at night.” 

“No problem,” said Harry. “See you in a bit.” 

He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was 
long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected 
places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid 
wall. 

“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the 
Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them. 

He gave the wall a little push. 

It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: 
Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself 
at once. They were standing in a dark corridor: Harry 
pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the 
pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s 
Map. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and 
located his and Luna’s dots at last. 



Page | 661 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching 
Filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead. 
“Come on, this way.” 

They crept off. 

Harry had prowled the castle at night many times 
before, but never had his heart hammered this fast, 
never had so much depended on his safe passage 
through the place. Through squares of moonlight 
upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets 
creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around 
corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry 
and Luna walked, checking the Marauder’s Map 
whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a 
ghost to pass without drawing attention to 
themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at 
any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he 
strained his ears with every step to hear the first, 
telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach. 

“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve 
and pulling him toward a spiral staircase. 

They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had 
never been up here before. At last they reached a 
door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing 
but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze 
knocker in the shape of an eagle. 

Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie 
floating in midair, unconnected to arm or body. She 
knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry 
like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle 
opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft, musical 
voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or the 
flame?” 



Page | 662 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, 
looking thoughtful. 

“What? Isn’t there just a password?” 

“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna. 

“What if you get it wrong?” 

“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it 
right,” said Luna. “That way you learn, you see?” 

“Yeah ... Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for 
anyone else, Luna.” 

“No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well 
then, I think the answer is that a circle has no 
beginning.” 

“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung 
open. 

The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, 
circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at 
Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the 
walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks: 

By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular 
view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was 
domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in 
the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, 
and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door 
stood a tall statue of white marble. 

Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he 
had seen at Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a 
door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He 
strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed 
to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her 
face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate- 
P a g e | 663 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top 
of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had 
worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched 
into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and 
climbed up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them. 

“ ‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’ ” 

“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a 
cackling voice. 

Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and 
landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of 
Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as 
Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby 
forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her 
forearm. 



Page | 664 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 





THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE 

The moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry’s 
scar burned savagely, the starry room vanished from 
sight, and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock 
beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around him 
and there was triumph in his heart — They have the 
boy. 

A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: 
Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch before 
him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so 
hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled. 

“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. 
lessons,” said Luna, sounding mildly interested. “That 
was noisier than I thought it would be.” 

And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. 
Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing louder 
from behind the door leading to the dormitories: 
Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above. 

“Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!” 

Page | 665 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to 
her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as 
the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in 
their nightclothes, flooded into the common room. 
There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw 
Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled 
in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any 
moment and attack them. Then one brave little first- 
year darted up to her and prodded her backside with 
his big toe. 

“I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight. 

“Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the 
Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. “They’re 
pleased!” 

“Yeah ... great ...” 

Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he 
chose to sink again into Voldemort’s mind. ... He was 
moving along the tunnel into the first cave. ... He had 
chosen to make sure of the locket before coming . . . 
but that would not take him long. . . . 

There was a rap on the common room door and every 
Ravenclaw froze. From the other side, Harry heard the 
soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door 
knocker: “Where do Vanished objects go?” 

“I dunno, do I? Shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice 
that Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother, 
Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got 
him? Open the door!” 

The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst 
themselves, terrified. Then, without warning, there 
came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was 
firing a gun into the door. 

Page | 666 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ALECTO\ If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter — 
d’you want to go the same way as the Malfoys? 
ANSWER ME!” Amyous bellowed, shaking the door for 
all he was worth, but still it did not open. The 
Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the 
most frightened began scampering back up the 
staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was 
wondering whether he ought not to blast open the 
door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could 
do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang 
out beyond the door. 

“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?” 

“Trying — to get — through this damned — door!” 
shouted Amycus. “Go and get Flitwick! Get him to 
open it, now!” 

“But isn’t your sister in there?” asked Professor 
McGonagall. “Didn’t Professor Flitwick let her in 
earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps 
she could open the door for you? Then you needn’t 
wake up half the castle.” 

“She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it! 
Garn! Do it, now! 

“Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall, 
with awful coldness. There was a genteel tap of the 
knocker and the musical voice asked again, 

“Where do Vanished objects go?” 

“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,” replied 
Professor McGonagall. 

“Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and 
the door swung open. 



Page | 667 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind 
sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the 
threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his 
sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, 
which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on 
the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear. 

“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed. 
“I’ll Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it 
— and what’s the Dark Lord going to say?” he 
shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking 
himself on the forehead with his fist. “We haven’t got 
him, and they’ve gorn and killed her!” 

“She’s only Stunned,” said Professor McGonagall 
impatiently, who had stooped down to examine 
Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all right.” 

“No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus. “Not 
after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She’s gorn and 
sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we’ve 
got Potter!” 

“ ‘Got Potter’?” said Professor McGonagall sharply. 
“What do you mean, ‘got Potter’?” 

“He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw 
Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!” 

“Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw 
Tower? Potter belongs in my House!” 

Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little 
strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva 
McGonagall gushed up inside him. 

“We was told he might come in here!” said Carrow. “I 
dunno why, do I?” 



Page | 668 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes 
swept the room. Twice they passed right over the 
place where Harry and Luna stood. 

“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his 
piglike face suddenly crafty. “Yeah, that’s what we’ll 
do. Well say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them 
kids up there” — he looked up at the starry ceiling 
toward the dormitories — “and we’ll say they forced 
her to press her Mark, and that’s why he got a false 
alarm. ... He can punish them. Couple of kids more or 
less, what’s the difference?” 

“Only the difference between truth and lies, courage 
and cowardice,” said Professor McGonagall, who had 
turned pale, “a difference, in short, which you and 
your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me 
make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass 
off your many ineptitudes on the students of 
Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.” 

“Excuse me?” 

Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close 
to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of 
hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at 
him as if he were something disgusting she had found 
stuck to a lavatory seat. 

“It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva 
McGonagall. Your time’s over. It’s us what’s in charge 
here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay the 
price.” 

And he spat in her face. 

Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, 
and said, “You shouldn’t have done that.” 



Page | 669 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio\” 



The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed 
through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and 
howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a 
shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a 
bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. 

“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood 
thundering through his brain, “you need to really 
mean it.” 

“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching 
her heart. “Potter — you’re here! What — ? How — ?” 
She struggled to pull herself together. “Potter, that 
was foolish!” 

“He spat at you,” said Harry. 

“Potter, I — that was very — very gallant of you — but 
don’t you realize — ?” 

“Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic 
steadied him. “Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on 
the way.” 

“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked 
Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility 
Cloak. This appearance of a second outlaw seemed to 
overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered 
backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at 
the neck of her old tartan dressing gown. 

“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call 
him,” Harry told Luna. “He already knows where I 
am.” 



In a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected 
to the angry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort 

Page | 670 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green 
boat. ... He had nearly reached the island where the 
stone basin stood. ... 

“You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. 
“Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!” 

“I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do. 
Professor, do you know where the diadem of 
Ravenclaw is?” 

“The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not — hasn’t 
it been lost for centuries?” She sat up a little 
straighter. “Potter, it was madness, utter madness, 
for you to enter this castle — ” 

“I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something 
hidden here that I’m supposed to find, and it could be 
the diadem — if I could just speak to Professor 
Flitwick — ” 

There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: 
Amycus was coming round. Before Harry or Luna 
could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, 
pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater, and 
said, “Imperio.” 

Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up 
her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor 
McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. 
Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor 
McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of 
shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and 
snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly 
together. 

“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face 
him again with superb indifference to the Carrows’ 



Page | 671 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




predicament, “if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does 
indeed know that you are here — ” 

As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain 
blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, and for 
a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion 
had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay 
safe beneath the surface — 

“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry 
came back: He was clutching Luna’s shoulder to 
steady himself. 

“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. 
Professor, I’m acting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must 
find what he wanted me to find! But we’ve got to get 
the students out while I’m searching the castle — it’s 
me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a 
few more or less, not now — ” not now he knows I’m 
attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in 
his head. 

“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated 
with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself 
up to her fullest height. 

“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must- 
Not-Be-Named while you search for this — this 
object.” 

“Is that possible?” 

“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we 
teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am 
sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all 
put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will 
have to be done about Professor Snape — ” 

“Let me — ” 

Page | 672 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ — and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, 
with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be 
advisable to take as many innocent people out of the 
way as possible. With the Floo Network under 
observation, and Apparition impossible within the 
grounds — ” 

“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained 
about the passageway leading into the Hog’s Head. 

“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students — ” 

“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death 
Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries 
they won’t be interested in anyone who’s 
Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.” 

“There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed 
her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon 
their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and 
hoisted them into the air, where they dangled beneath 
the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea 
creatures. “Come. We must alert the other Heads of 
House. You’d better put that Cloak back on.” 

She marched toward the door, and as she did so she 
raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver cats 
with spectacle markings around their eyes. The 
Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral 
staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, 
Harry, and Luna hurried back down. 

Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the 
Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan 
dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and 
Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak. 

They had descended two more floors when another 
set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. Harry, whose scar 

Page | 673 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




was still prickling, heard them first: He felt in the 
pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s Map, but 
before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to 
become aware of their company. She halted, raised 
her wand ready to duel, and said, “Who’s there?” 

“It is I,” said a low voice. 

From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape. 

Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had 
forgotten the details of Snape ’s appearance in the 
magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy 
black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how 
his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not 
wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual 
black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready 
for a fight. 

“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly. 

“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” 
said Professor McGonagall. 

Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over 
Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as if he 
knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up 
too, ready to attack. 

“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto 
had apprehended an intruder.” 

“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave 
you that impression?” 

Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, 
where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin. 



Page | 674 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You 
Death Eaters have your own private means of 
communication, I forgot.” 

Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were 
still probing the air all about her, and he was moving 
gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what 
he was doing. 

“I did not know that it was your night to patrol the 
corridors, Minerva.” 

“You have some objection?” 

“I wonder what could have brought you out of your 
bed at this late hour?” 

“I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor 
McGonagall. 

“Really? But all seems calm.” 

Snape looked into her eyes. 

“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you 
have, I must insist — ” 

Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could 
have believed: Her wand slashed through the air and 
for a split second Harry thought that Snape must 
crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield 
Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off 
balance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the 
wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to 
curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way 
of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire 
that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape 



Page | 675 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent 
that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed 
and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of 
pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by 
forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with 
echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, 
into its breast — 

“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind 
him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw 
Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the 
corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the 
enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the 
rear. 

“No!” squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do 
no more murder at Hogwarts!” 

Flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which 
Snape had taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. 
Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it 
flying back toward his attackers: Harry and Luna had 
to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall 
and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape 
was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all 
thundering after him: He hurtled through a classroom 
door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, 
“Coward! COWARD !” 

“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna. 

Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along 
the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind 
them, into the deserted classroom where Professors 
McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a 
smashed window. 

“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and 
Luna ran into the room. 

Page | 676 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You mean he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, 
ignoring Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his 
sudden appearance. 

“No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike 
Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand ... and he 
seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.” 

With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a 
huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness 
toward the perimeter wall. 

There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great 
deal of puffing: Slughorn had just caught up. 

“Harry!” he panted, massaging his immense chest 
beneath his emerald-green silk pajamas. “My dear 
boy ... what a surprise ... Minerva, do please explain. 
... Severus ... what ... ?” 

“Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said 
Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped 
hole in the window. 

“Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. 
He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, 
and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the 
underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with 
murder in his heart — 

“Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s 
coming now!” 

“Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,” 
she told the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick 
gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan. “Potter has 
work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s orders. We 
need to put in place every protection of which we are 
capable while Potter does what he needs to do.” 

Page | 677 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able 
to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely?” squeaked 
Flitwick. 

“But we can hold him up,” said Professor Sprout. 

“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, 
and between the two witches there passed a look of 
grim understanding. “I suggest we establish basic 
protection around the place, then gather our students 
and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, 
though if any of those who are over age wish to stay 
and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.” 

“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying 
toward the door. “I shall meet you in the Great Hall in 
twenty minutes with my House.” 

And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her 
muttering, “Tentacula. Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff 
pods ... yes, I’d like to see the Death Eaters fighting 
those.” 

“I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he 
could barely see out of it, he pointed his wand 
through the smashed window and started muttering 
incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird 
rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the 
power of the wind into the grounds. 

“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms 
master, “Professor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is 
important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of 
Ravenclaw is?” 

“ — Protego Horribilis — the diadem of Ravenclaw?” 
squeaked Flitwick. “A little extra wisdom never goes 
amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much 
use in this situation!” 

Page | 678 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I only meant — do you know where it is? Have you 
ever seen it?” 

“Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long 
since lost, boy!” 

Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and 
panic. What, then, was the Horcrux? 

“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great 
Hall, Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to 
Harry and Luna to follow her. 

They had just reached the door when Slughorn 
rumbled into speech. 

“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus 
mustache aquiver. “What a to-do! I’m not at all sure 
whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a 
way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay 
him will be in most grievous peril — ” 

“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great 
Hall in twenty minutes, also,” said Professor 
McGonagall. “If you wish to leave with your students, 
we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to 
sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us 
within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.” 

“Minerva!” he said, aghast. 

“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide 
upon its loyalties,” interrupted Professor McGonagall. 
“Go and wake your students, Horace.” 

Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and 
Luna ran after Professor McGonagall, who had taken 
up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised 
her wand. 

Page | 679 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Piertotum — oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now — ” 



The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, 
shouting, “Students out of bed! Students in the 
corridors!” 

“They’re supposed to be, you blithering idiot!” shouted 
McGonagall. “Now go and do something constructive! 
Find Peeves!” 

“P-Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never 
heard the name before. 

“Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peevesl Haven’t you been 
complaining about him for a quarter of a century? Go 
and fetch him, at once!” 

Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had 
taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, hunch- 
shouldered, muttering under his breath. 

“And now — Piertotum Locomotori” cried Professor 
McGonagall. 

And all along the corridor the statues and suits of 
armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the 
echoing crashes from the floors above and below, 
Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle 
had done the same. 

“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor 
McGonagall. “Man the boundaries, protect us, do 
your duty to our school!” 

Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues 
stampeded past Harry: some of them smaller, others 
larger, than life. There were animals too, and the 
clanking suits of armor brandished swords and 
spiked balls on chains. 

Page | 680 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss 
Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring 
them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the other 
Gryffindors.” 

They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry 
and Luna running back toward the concealed 
entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, 
they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling 
cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to 
the Great Hall by teachers and prefects. 

“That was Potter!” 

“ Harry Potted” 

“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!” 

But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached 
the entrance to the Room of Requirement. Harry 
leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to 
admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the 
steep staircase. 

“Wh — ?” 

As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few 
stairs in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than 
when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin 
were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie 
Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and 
Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. 

“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him 
at the foot of the stairs. 

“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the 
school — Snape’s run for it — What are you doing 
here? How did you know?” 

Page | 681 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,” 
Fred explained. “You couldn’t expect everyone to miss 
the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the 
Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed.” 

“What first, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?” 

“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s 
meeting in the Great Hall to get organized,” Harry 
said. “We’re fighting.” 

There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of 
the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as 
they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order 
of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, and Harry’s old 
Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading 
up into the main castle. 

“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding 
out his free hand; she took it and followed him back 
up the stairs. 

The crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people 
remained below in the Room of Requirement, and 
Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with 
Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, 
and Fleur. 

“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her 
daughter as Harry approached. “I won’t permit it! The 
boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to go home!” 

“I won’t!” 

Ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her 
mother’s grip. 

“I’m in Dumbledore’s Army — ” 



Page | 682 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“A teenagers’ gang!” 



“A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which 
no one else has dared to do!” said Fred. 

“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “She’s not old 
enough! What you two were thinking, bringing her 
with you — ” 

Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of 
themselves. 

“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do 
this. Everyone underage will have to leave, it’s only 
right.” 

“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears 
sparkling in her eyes. “My whole family’s here, I can’t 
stand waiting there alone and not knowing and — ” 

Her eyes met Harry’s for the first time. She looked at 
him beseechingly, but he shook his head and she 
turned away bitterly. 

“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel 
back to the Hog’s Head. “I’ll say good-bye now, then, 
and—” 

There was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone 
else had clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced 
slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on the 
nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn- 
rimmed glasses, and said, “Am I too late? Has it 
started? I only just found out, so I — I — ” 

Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not 
expected to run into most of his family. There was a 
long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur 
turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent 

Page | 683 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




attempt to break the tension, “So — ’ow eez leetle 
Teddy?” 

Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between 
the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying, like ice. 

“I — oh yes — he’s fine!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes, 
Tonks is with him — at her mother’s — ” 

Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one 
another, frozen. 

“Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a 
photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to 
Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of 
bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera. 

“I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin 
nearly dropped his photograph. “I was an idiot, I was 
a pompous prat, I was a — a — ” 

“Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry 
moron,” said Fred. 

Percy swallowed. 

“Yes, I was!” 

“Well, you can’t say fairer than that,” said Fred, 
holding out his hand to Percy. 

Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, 
pushed Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a strangling 
hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his 
father. 

“I’m sorry, Dad,” Percy said. 



Page | 684 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too 
hurried to hug his son. 

“What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George. 

“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping 
his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his 
traveling cloak. “But I had to find a way out and it’s 
not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprisoning 
traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with 
Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that 
Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I 
am.” 



“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at 
times such as these,” said George in a good imitation 
of Percy’s most pompous manner. “Now let’s get 
upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters’ll be 
taken.” 

“So, you’re my sister-in-law now?” said Percy, shaking 
hands with Fleur as they hurried off toward the 
staircase with Bill, Fred, and George. 

“Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley. 

Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the 
reconciliation, to sneak upstairs too. 

“Molly, how about this,” said Lupin. “Why doesn’t 
Ginny stay here, then at least she’ll be on the scene 
and know what’s going on, but she won’t be in the 
middle of the fighting?” 



“That’s a good idea,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “Ginny, 
you stay in this room, you hear me?” 



Page | 685 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under 
her father’s unusually stern gaze, she nodded. Mr. 
and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off for the stairs 
as well. 

“Where’s Ron?” asked Harry. “Where’s Hermione?” 

“They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” 
Mr. Weasley called over his shoulder. 

“I didn’t see them pass me,” said Harry. 

“They said something about a bathroom,” said Ginny, 
“not long after you left.” 

“A bathroom?” 

Harry strode across the room to an open door leading 
off the Room of Requirement and checked the 
bathroom beyond. It was empty. 

“You’re sure they said bath — ?” 

But then his scar seared and the Room of 
Requirement vanished: He was looking through the 
high wrought-iron gates with winged boars on pillars 
at either side, looking through the dark grounds 
toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. 
Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He was 
possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that 
preceded murder.

THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS 

The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and 
scattered with stars, and below it the four long House 
tables were lined with disheveled students, some in 
traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and 
there shone the pearly white figures of the school 
ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon 
Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the 
raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her 
stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino 
centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the 
Phoenix who had arrived to fight. 

"... evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and 
Madam Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you 
will organize your House and take your charges, in an 
orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.” 

Many of the students looked petrified. However, as 
Harry skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table 
for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at 
the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we 
want to stay and fight?” 

Page | 687 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



There was a smattering of applause. 

“If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor 
McGonagall. 

“What about our things?” called a girl at the 
Ravenclaw table. “Our trunks, our owls?” 

“We have no time to collect possessions,” said 
Professor McGonagall. “The important thing is to get 
you out of here safely.” 

“Where’s Professor Snape?” shouted a girl from the 
Slytherin table. 

“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” 
replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer 
erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and 
Ravenclaws. 

Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor 
table, still looking for Ron and Hermione. As he 
passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal 
of whispering broke out in his wake. 

“We have already placed protection around the 
castle,” Professor McGonagall was saying, “but it is 
unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I 
must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, 
and do as your prefects — ” 

But her final words were drowned as a different voice 
echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, cold, and 
clear: There was no telling from where it came; it 
seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the 
monster it had once commanded, it might have lain 
dormant there for centuries. 



Page | 688 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I know that you are preparing to fight.” There were 
screams amongst the students, some of whom 
clutched each other, looking around in terror for the 
source of the sound. “Your efforts are futile. You 
cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great 
respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to 
spill magical blood.” 

There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence 
that presses against the eardrums, that seems too 
huge to be contained by walls. 

“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and 
none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I 
shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry 
Potter, and you will be rewarded. 

“You have until midnight.” 

The silence swallowed them all again. Every head 
turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found 
Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of 
invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin 
table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she 
raised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there! 
Potter’s there\ Someone grab him!” 

Before Harry could speak, there was a massive 
movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had risen 
and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then 
the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same 
moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs 
to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, 
and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands 
emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and 
from under sleeves. 

“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor 
McGonagall in a clipped voice. “You will leave the Hall 

Page | 689 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could 
follow.” 

Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the 
sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side 
of the Hall. 

“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall. 

Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table 
was completely deserted, but a number of older 
Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed 
out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of 
Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating 
Professor McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’ 
platform to chivvy the underage on their way. 

“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!” 

Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting 
together at the Gryffindor table. 

“Where are Ron and Hermione?” 

“Haven’t you found — ?” began Mr. Weasley, looking 
worried. 

But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on 
the raised platform to address those who had 
remained behind. 

“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we 
need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed 
between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of 
the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and 
McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to 
the three highest towers — Ravenclaw, Astronomy, 
and Gryffindor — where they’ll have a good overview, 
excellent positions from which to work spells. 

Page | 690 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Meanwhile Remus” — he indicated Lupin — “Arthur” 
— he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the 
Gryffindor table — “and I will take groups into the 
grounds. We’ll need somebody to organize defense of 
the entrances of the passageways into the school — ” 

“Sounds like a job for us,” called Fred, indicating 
himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his 
approval. 

“All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the 
troops!” 

“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to 
him, as students flooded the platform, jostling for 
position, receiving instructions, “ Aren’t you supposed 
to be looking for something?” 

“What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!” 

He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost 
forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he 
could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron 
and Hermione had momentarily driven every other 
thought from his mind. 

“Then go, Potter, go!” 

“Right — yeah — ” 

He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the 
Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still crowded 
with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be 
swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the 
top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and 
panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried 
to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the 
Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and 
fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without 
Page | 691 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to 
marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt 
halfway along an empty passage, where he sat down 
upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the 
Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck. 

He could not see Ron’s or Hermione’s names 
anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of 
dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement 
might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the 
map away, pressed his hands over his face, and 
closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. ... 

Voldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower. 

There it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort 
had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw 
common room, and there could only be one 
explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already 
knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. 

But the only object anyone seemed to associate with 
Ravenclaw was the lost diadem . . . and how could the 
Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that 
Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that 
had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could 
have told him where to look, when nobody had seen 
the diadem in living memory? 

In living memory ... 

Beneath his fingers, Harry’s eyes flew open again. He 
leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had 
come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound 
of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of 
Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned 
to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting 
instructions, trying to keep track of the students in 
their own Houses; there was much pushing and 
shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over 
Page | 692 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and 
there younger students were in tears, while older ones 
called desperately for friends or siblings. ... 

Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting 
across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as 
he could over the clamor. 

“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!” 

He forced his way back through the tide of students, 
finally reaching the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly 
Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood 
waiting for him. 

“Harry! My dear boy!” 

Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his 
own: Harry’s felt as though they had been thrust into 
icy water. 

“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of 
Ravenclaw Tower?” 

Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little 
offended. 

“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services 
you require — ?” 

“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?” 

“Let’s see. ...” 

Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned 
hither and thither, peering over the heads of the 
swarming students. 



Page | 693 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with 
the long hair.” 

Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, 
pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight 
of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and 
drifted away through a solid wall. 

Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the 
corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her 
at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly 
away from him. 

“Hey — wait — come back!” 

She consented to pause, floating a few inches from 
the ground. Harry supposed that she was beautiful, 
with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but 
she also looked haughty and proud. Close to, he 
recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times 
in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken. 

“You’re the Gray Lady?” 

She nodded but did not speak. 

“The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?” 

“That is correct.” 

Her tone was not encouraging. 

“Please: I need some help. I need to know anything 
you can tell me about the lost diadem.” 

A cold smile curved her lips. 

“I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot 
help you.” 

Page | 694 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“WAIT!” 



He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were 
threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced at his 
watch as she hovered in front of him: It was a quarter 
to midnight. 

“This is urgent,” he said fiercely. “If that diadem’s at 
Hogwarts, I’ve got to find it, fast.” 

“You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” 
she said disdainfully. “Generations of students have 
badgered me — ” 

“This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry 
shouted at her. “It’s about Voldemort — defeating 
Voldemort — or aren’t you interested in that?” 

She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks 
became more opaque, and her voice was heated as 
she replied, “Of course I — how dare you suggest — ?” 

“Well, help me, then!” 

Her composure was slipping. 

“It — it is not a question of — ” she stammered. “My 
mother’s diadem — ” 

“Your mother’s?” 

She looked angry with herself. 

“When I lived,” she said stiffly, “I was Helena 
Ravenclaw.” 

“You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what 
happened to it!” 



Page | 695 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an 
obvious effort to pull herself together, “I doubt that it 
would greatly increase your chances of defeating the 
wizard who calls himself Lord — ” 

“Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing 
it!” Harry said fiercely. “There’s no time to explain — 
but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see 
Voldemort finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you 
know about the diadem!” 

She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring 
down at him, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed 
Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she 
would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had 
surely asked her the same question. He had shaken 
his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a 
low voice. 

“I stole the diadem from my mother.” 

“You — you did what?” 

“ I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a 
whisper. “I sought to make myself cleverer, more 
important than my mother. I ran away with it.” 

He did not know how he had managed to gain her 
confidence, and did not ask; he simply listened, hard, 
as she went on: 

“My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem 
was gone, but pretended that she had it still. She 
concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from 
the other founders of Hogwarts. 

“Then my mother fell ill — fatally ill. In spite of my 
perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time. 
She sent a man who had long loved me, though I 

Page | 696 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he 
would not rest until he had done so.” 



Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back 
her head. 

“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. 

When I refused to return with him, he became violent. 
The Baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious 
at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.” 

“The Baron? You mean — ?” 

“The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she 
lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark 
wound in her white chest. “When he saw what he had 
done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the 
weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill 
himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains 
as an act of penitence ... as he should,” she added 
bitterly. 

“And . . . and the diadem?” 

“It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the 
Baron blundering through the forest toward me. 
Concealed inside a hollow tree. 

“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where 
was this?” 

“A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far 
beyond my mother’s reach.” 

“Albania,” repeated Harry. Sense was emerging 
miraculously from confusion, and now he understood 
why she was telling him what she had denied 
Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already told 
someone this story, haven’t you? Another student?” 
Page | 697 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




She closed her eyes and nodded. 



“I had ... no idea. . . . He was . . . flattering. He seemed 
to ... to understand ... to sympathize. ...” 

Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have 
understood Helena Ravenclaw’s desire to possess 
fabulous objects to which she had little right. 

“Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed 
things out of,” Harry muttered. “He could be 
charming when he wanted. ...” 

So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of 
the lost diadem out of the Gray Lady. He had traveled 
to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from 
its hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, 
before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes. 

And wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have 
seemed an excellent refuge when, so much later, 
Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, 
for ten long years? 

But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, 
had not been left in that lowly tree. ... No, the diadem 
had been returned secretly to its true home, and 
Voldemort must have put it there — 

“ — the night he asked for a job!” said Harry, finishing 
his thought. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked 
Dumbledore to let him teach!” said Harry. Saying it 
out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. “He 
must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down 
from, Dumbledore ’s office! But it was still worth trying 
Page | 698 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




to get the job — then he might’ve got the chance to 
nick Gryffindor’s sword as well — thank you, thanks!” 



Harry left her floating there, looking utterly 
bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the 
entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five 
minutes until midnight, and though he now knew 
what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to 
discovering where it was. ... 

Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; 
that suggested that it was not in Ravenclaw Tower — 
but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom 
Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that he 
believed would remain secret forever? 

Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, 
but he had taken only a few steps down the new 
corridor when the window to his left broke open with 
a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a 
gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the 
opposite wall. Something large and furry detached 
itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung 
itself at Harry. 

“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the 
boarhound’s attentions as the enormous bearded 
figure clambered to his feet. “What the — ?” 

“Harry, yer here! Yer here\” 

Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory 
and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered 
window. 

“Good boy, Grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in 
the window. “I’ll see yer in a moment, there’s a good 
lad!” 

Page | 699 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw 
bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird, 
keening scream. He looked down at his watch: It was 
midnight. The battle had begun. 

“Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh? Time 
ter fight?” 

“Hagrid, where have you come from?” 

“Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,” said 
Hagrid grimly. “Voice carried, didn’ it? Yeh got till 
midnight ter gimme Potter.’ Knew yeh mus’ be here, 
knew what mus’ be happenin’. Get down, Fang. So we 
come ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang. Smashed 
our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy 
was carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter let me 
down at the castle, so he shoved me through the 
window, bless him. Not exac’ly what I meant, bu’ — 
where’s Ron an’ Hermione?” 

“That,” said Harry, “is a really good question. Come 
on.” 

They hurried together along the corridor, Fang 
lolloping beside them. Harry could hear movement 
through the corridors all around: running footsteps, 
shouts; through the windows, he could see more 
flashes of light in the dark grounds. 

“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at 
Harry’s heels, making the floorboards quake. 

“I dunno exactly,” said Harry, making another 
random turn, “but Ron and Hermione must be 
around here somewhere. ...” 

The first casualties of the battle were already strewn 
across the passage ahead: The two stone gargoyles 

Page | 700 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom 
had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed 
through another broken window. Their remains 
stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one 
of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly, “Oh, 
don’t mind me ... I’ll just lie here and crumble. ...” 

Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the 
marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius’s 
house, wearing that mad headdress — and then of 
the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem 
upon her white curls. ... 

And as he reached the end of the passage, the 
memory of a third stone effigy came back to him: that 
of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry 
himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. The 
shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, 
and he nearly stumbled. 

He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for 
him. ... 

Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated 
alone, might have been arrogant enough to assume 
that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest 
mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore 
and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in 
that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off 
the beaten track in his time at school — here at last 
was a secret he and Voldemort knew, that 
Dumbledore had never discovered — 

He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was 
thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen 
others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying 
what appeared to be large potted plants. 



Page | 701 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at Harry over his 
shoulder as he ran. “Going to lob them over the walls 
— they won’t like this!” 

Harry knew now where to go: He sped off, with Hagrid 
and Fang galloping behind him. They passed portrait 
after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside 
them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in 
armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each 
others’ canvases, screaming news from other parts of 
the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, 
the whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic 
vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it 
was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than 
those of the teachers and the Order. 

“It’s all righ’, Fang — it’s all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but 
the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of 
china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid 
pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving Harry 
alone. 

He forged on through the trembling passages, his 
wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor 
the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from 
painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his 
armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony 
cantering behind him. 

“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive 
them out, Harry Potter, see them off!” 

Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a 
small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and 
Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty 
plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret 
passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were 
listening at the concealed hole. 



Page | 702 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Nice night for it!” Fred shouted as the castle quaked 
again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in 
equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, 
and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris 
was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no 
doubt to return them to their proper place. ... 

“Potter!” 

Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor 
ahead, his wand held ready. 

“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my 
pub, Potter!” 

“I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, “Voldemort’s 



“ — attacking because they haven’t handed you over, 
yeah,” said Aberforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of 
Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any 
of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are 
kids of Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. 
Wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here?” 

“It wouldn’t stop Voldemort,” said Harry, “and your 
brother would never have done it.” 

Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite 
direction. 

Your brother would never have done it. ... Well, it was 
the truth, Harry thought as he ran on again; 
Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, 
would never have held students ransom. ... 

And then he skidded around a final corner and with a 
yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and 
Hermione, both with their arms full of large, curved, 

Page | 703 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his 
arm. 

“Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted. 

“Chamber of Secrets,” said Ron. 

“Chamber — what?” said Harry, coming to an 
unsteady halt before them. 

“It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” said Hermione 
breathlessly. “Wasn’t it absolutely brilliant? There we 
were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even if we find 
the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We 
still hadn’t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of 
it! The basilisk!” 

“What the — ?” 

“Something to get rid of Horcruxes,” said Ron simply. 

Harry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron 
and Hermione’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, he 
now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. 

“But how did you get in there?” he asked, staring 
from the fangs to Ron. “You need to speak 
Parseltongue!” 

“He did!” whispered Hermione. “Show him, Ron!” 

Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise. 

“It’s what you did to open the locket,” he told Harry 
apologetically. “I had to have a few goes to get it right, 
but,” he shrugged modestly, “we got there in the end.” 

“He was amazing.” said Hermione. “Amazing!” 



Page | 704 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“So ...” Harry was struggling to keep up. “So ...” 



“So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from 
under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of 
Hufflepuff’s cup. “Hermione stabbed it. Thought she 
should. She hasn’t had the pleasure yet.” 

“Genius!” yelled Harry. 

“It was nothing,” said Ron, though he looked 
delighted with himself. “So what’s new with you?” 

As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: 
All three of them looked up as dust fell from the 
ceiling and they heard a distant scream. 

“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where 
it is,” said Harry, talking fast. “He hid it exactly where 
I hid my old Potions book, where everyone’s been 
hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only 
one to find it. Come on.” 

As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back 
through the concealed entrance and down the 
staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty 
except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly 
witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry 
recognized immediately as Neville’s grandmother. 

“Ah, Potter,” she said crisply as if she had been 
waiting for him. “You can tell us what’s going on.” 

“Is everyone okay?” said Ginny and Tonks together. 

“ ’S far as we know,” said Harry. “Are there still people 
in the passage to the Hog’s Head?” 

He knew that the room would not be able to 
transform while there were still users inside it. 

Page | 705 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs. 
Longbottom. “I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it 
open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen 
my grandson?” 

“He’s fighting,” said Harry. 

“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly. “Excuse me, I 
must go and assist him.” 

With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone 
steps. 

Harry looked at Tonks. 

“I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at 
your mother’s?” 

“I couldn’t stand not knowing — ” Tonks looked 
anguished. “She’ll look after him — have you seen 
Remus?” 

“He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the 
grounds — ” 

Without another word, Tonks sped off. 

“Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to 
leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.” 

Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. 

“And then you can come back in!” he shouted after 
her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. “ You’ve got to 
come back ini” 

“Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve 
forgotten someone!” 



Page | 706 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Who?” asked Hermione. 



“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, 
won’t they?” 

“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked 
Harry. 

“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them 
to get out. We don’t want any more Dobbies, do we? 
We can’t order them to die for us — ” 

There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out 
of Hermione ’s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them 
around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. 
Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was 
holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he 
lifted Hermione off her feet. 

“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when 
nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione 
gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on 
the spot, he raised his voice. “01! There’s a war going 
on here!” 

Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still 
around each other. 

“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he 
had recently been hit on the back of the head with a 
Bludger, “so it’s now or never, isn’t it?” 

“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry 
shouted. “D’you think you could just — just hold it in 
until we’ve got the diadem?” 

“Yeah — right — sorry — ” said Ron, and he and 
Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in 
the face. 

Page | 707 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into 
the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they 
had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation 
within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls 
and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled 
the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw 
bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the 
castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very 
near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw 
Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what 
looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and 
roaring his displeasure. 

“Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as 
more screams echoed from close by. 

“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry 
turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their 
wands drawn at the next window, which was missing 
several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well- 
aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. 

“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust 
toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray 
hair flying as he led a small group of students past. 
“They look like they might be breaching the north 
battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own!” 

“Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him. 

“He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, 

“haven’t seen him since! 

“Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay — ” 
But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. 
Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 



Page | 708 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“They’ll be all right,” said Harry, though he knew they 
were empty words. “Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, 
just keep out of the way, keep safe — come on!” he 
said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the 
stretch of wall beyond which the Room of 
Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next 
entrant. 

I need the place where everything is hidden, Harry 
begged of it inside his head, and the door materialized 
on their third run past. 

The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed 
the threshold and closed the door behind them: All 
was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral 
with the appearance of a city, its towering walls built 
of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students. 

“And he never realized anyone could get in?” said 
Ron, his voice echoing in the silence. 

“He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too 
bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in my time ... this 
way,” he added, “I think it’s down here. ...” 

He passed the stuffed troll and the Vanishing Cabinet 
Draco Malfoy had mended last year with such 
disastrous consequences, then hesitated, looking up 
and down aisles of junk; he could not remember 
where to go next. ... 

“ Accio Diadem).” cried Hermione in desperation, but 
nothing flew through the air toward them. It seemed 
that, like the vault at Gringotts, the room would not 
yield its hidden objects that easily. 

“Let’s split up,” Harry told the other two. “Look for a 
stone bust of an old man wearing a wig and a tiara! 



Page | 709 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




It’s standing on a cupboard and it’s definitely 
somewhere near here. ...” 



They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the 
others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of 
junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, 
broomsticks, bats. ... 

“Somewhere near here,” Harry muttered to himself. 
“Somewhere ... somewhere ...” 

Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking 
for objects he recognized from his one previous trip 
into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and 
then his very soul seemed to shiver: There it was, 
right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he 
had hidden his old Potions book, and on top of it, the 
pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig 
and what looked like an ancient, discolored tiara. 

He had already stretched out his hand, though he 
remained ten feet away, when a voice behind him 
said, “Hold it, Potter.” 

He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and 
Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder to 
shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the 
small space between their leering faces he saw Draco 
Malfoy. 

“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” said Malfoy, 
pointing his own through the gap between Crabbe 
and Goyle. 

“Not anymore,” panted Harry, tightening his grip on 
the hawthorn wand. “Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s 
lent you theirs?” 

“My mother,” said Draco. 

Page | 710 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry laughed, though there was nothing very 
humorous about the situation. He could not hear Ron 
or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out 
of earshot, searching for the diadem. 

“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” 
asked Harry. 

“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe: His voice 
was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person; 
Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. 

Crabbe was smiling like a small child promised a 
large bag of sweets. “We ’ung back, Potter. We decided 
not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.” 

“Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration. He could 
not believe that he was this close, and was going to be 
thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began 
edging slowly backward toward the place where the 
Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just 
get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . . 

“So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to 
distract them. 

“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last 
year,” said Malfoy, his voice brittle. “I know how to get 
in.” 



“We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted 
Goyle. “We can do Diss-lusion Charms now! And 
then,” his face split into a gormless grin, “you turned 
up right in front of us and said you was looking for a 
die-dum! What’s a die-dum?” 

“Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other 
side of the wall to Harry’s right. “Are you talking to 
someone?” 



Page | 711 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand 
at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, of broken 
trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable 
junk, and shouted, “DescendoV’ 

The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled 
into the aisle next door where Ron stood. 

“Ron!” Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight 
Hermione screamed, and Harry heard innumerable 
objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the 
destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, 
cried, “Finite!” and it steadied. 

“No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the 
latter made to repeat his spell. “If you wreck the room 
you might bury this diadem thing!” 

“What’s that matter?” said Crabbe, tugging himself 
free. “It’s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares 
about a die-dum?” 

“Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with ill- 
disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his 
colleagues, “so that must mean — ” 

“ ‘Must mean?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with 
undisguised ferocity. “Who cares what you think? I 
don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You an’ your 
dad are finished.” 

“Harry?” shouted Ron again, from the other side of 
the junk wall. “What’s going on?” 

“Harry?” mimicked Crabbe. “What’s going — no, 

Potter! Cruciol” 

Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed 
him but hit the stone bust, which flew into the air; 

Page | 712 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of 
sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had 
rested. 

“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing 
through the enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants 
him alive — ” 

“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, 
throwing off Malfoy’s restraining arm. “But if I can, I 
will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what’s 
thediff— ?” 

A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: 
Hermione had run around the corner behind him and 
sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe ’s head. It 
only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the 
way. 

“It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavral” 

Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that 
Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. 
He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out 
of the way, knocking Malfoy’s wand out of his hand; it 
rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken 
furniture and boxes. 

“Don’t kill him! DONT KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at 
Crabbe and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: 
Their split second’s hesitation was all Harry needed. 

“ Expelliarmusl” 

Goyle ’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared 
into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt 
foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy 
jumped out of range of Hermione ’s second Stunning 
Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the 
Page | 713 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which 
narrowly missed. 

Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada 
KedavraY’ again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet 
of green light. The wandless Malfoy cowered behind a 
three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward 
them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she 
came. 

“It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at 
the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. 
“Look for it while I go and help R — ” 

“HARRY!” she screamed. 

A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a 
moment’s warning. He turned and saw both Ron and 
Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle 
toward them. 

“Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran. 

But he seemed to have no control over what he had 
done. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, 
licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were 
crumbling to soot at their touch. 

“Aguamenti\” Harry bawled, but the jet of water that 
soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air. 

“RUN!” 

Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him 
along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking 
terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in 
his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not 
normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry 
had no knowledge: As they turned a corner the flames 
Page | 714 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




chased them as though they were alive, sentient, 
intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, 
forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming 
serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and 
rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which 
they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their 
fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before 
being consumed by the inferno. 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery 
monsters were circling them, drawing closer and 
closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat 
was solid as a wall around them. 

“What can we do?” Hermione screamed over the 
deafening roars of the fire. “What can we do?” 

“Here!” 

Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from 
the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who 
pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his 
leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the 
ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet 
the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its 
jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming 
overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was 
consuming the contraband of generations of hunted 
students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned 
experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who 
had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a 
trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere: He 
swooped as low as he dared over the marauding 
monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was 
nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. ... He had 
never wanted this. ... 



Page | 715 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed Ron, 
though it was impossible to see where the door was 
through the black smoke. 

And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream 
from amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of 
devouring flame. 

“It’s — too — dangerous — !” Ron yelled, but Harry 
wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes some 
small protection from the smoke, he raked the 
firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face 
that was not yet charred like wood. ... 

And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the 
unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a 
fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. 

Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even 
as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no 
good: Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy ’s hand, covered 
in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry’s — 

“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” 
roared Ron’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera 
bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged 
Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, 
into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind 
Harry. 

“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed Malfoy 
in Harry’s ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, 
Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black 
smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them 
the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames 
were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed 
fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a 
sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara — 



Page | 716 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s 
that way\” screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a 
hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall 
in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped 
toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he 
had it, caught it around his wrist — 

Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he 
soared upward and straight toward the place where, 
he prayed, the door stood open: Ron, Hermione, and 
Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and 
holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the 
smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall 
and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean 
air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in 
the corridor beyond. 

Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, 
coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: 
The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, 
and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside 
Goyle, who was still unconscious. 

“C-Crabbe,” choked Malfoy as soon as he could 
speak. “C-Crabbe ...” 

“He’s dead,” said Ron harshly. 

There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. 
Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a 
great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past 
on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust 
under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when 
the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: 

The battle was still going on all around him. He could 
hear more screams than those of the retreating 
ghosts. Panic flared within him. 



Page | 717 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Where’s Ginny?” he said sharply. “She was here. She 
was supposed to be going back into the Room of 
Requirement.” 

“Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” 
asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, rubbing his 
chest and looking left and right. “Shall we split up 
and look — ?” 

“No,” said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy 
and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the 
corridor floor; neither of them had wands. “Let’s stick 
together. I say we go — Harry, what’s that on your 
arm?” 

“What? Oh yeah — ” 

He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It 
was still hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at 
it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words 
etched upon it: WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN’S 
GREATEST TREASURE. 

A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be 
leaking from the diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the 
thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, 
and as it did so, he thought he heard the faintest, 
most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the 
grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had 
just fragmented in his fingers. 

“It must have been Fiendfyre!” whimpered Hermione, 
her eyes on the broken pieces. 

“Sorry?” 

“Fiendfyre — cursed fire — it’s one of the substances 
that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have 



Page | 718 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




dared use it, it’s so dangerous — how did Crabbe 
know how to — ?” 

“Must’ve learned from the Carrows,” said Harry 
grimly. 

“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they 
mentioned how to stop it, really,” said Ron, whose 
hair, like Hermione’s, was singed, and whose face was 
blackened. “If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d be quite 
sorry he was dead.” 

“But don’t you realize?” whispered Hermione. “This 
means, if we can just get the snake — ” 

But she broke off as yells and shouts and the 
unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. 
Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail: 
Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and 
Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling 
masked and hooded men. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of 
light flew in every direction and the man dueling 
Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they 
saw a high forehead and streaked hair — 

“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx 
straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and 
clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful 
discomfort. “Did I mention I’m resigning?” 

“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death 
Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of 
three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen 
to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; 
he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. 
Fred looked at Percy with glee. 



Page | 719 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You actually are joking, Perce. ... I don’t think I’ve 
heard you joke since you were — ” 

The air exploded. They had been grouped together, 
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two 
Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other 
Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, 
when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world 
was rent apart. Harry felt himself flying through the 
air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible 
to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only 
weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard 
the screams and yells of his companions without a 
hope of knowing what had happened to them — 

And then the world resolved itself into pain and 
semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of 
a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible 
attack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle 
had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his 
cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then 
he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that 
expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse 
could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more 
frightened than he had been that day, more 
frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life. ... 

And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the 
wreckage, and three redheaded men were grouped on 
the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry 
grabbed Hermione ’s hand as they staggered and 
stumbled over stone and wood. 

“No — no — no!” someone was shouting. “No! Fred! 
No!” 

And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was 
kneeling beside them, and Fred’s eyes stared without 



Page | 720 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon 
his face. 



Page | 721 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE ELDER WAND 

The world had ended, so why had the battle not 
ceased, the castle fallen silent in horror, and every 
combatant laid down their arms? Harry’s mind was in 
free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the 
impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be 
dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying — 

And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side 
of the school, and curses flew in at them from the 
darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads. 

“Get down!” Harry shouted, as more curses flew 
through the night: He and Ron had both grabbed 
Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay 
across Fred’s body, shielding it from further harm, 
and when Harry shouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got 
to move!” he shook his head. 

“Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime 
coating Ron’s face as he seized his elder brother’s 
shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. 



Page | 722 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“Percy, you can’t do anything for him! We’re going to 



Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need 
to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car 
was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall: 
One of Aragog’s descendants had joined the fight. 

Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided 
and the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking 
horribly, and vanished into the darkness. 

“It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, 
glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole 
in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders 
were climbing the side of the building, liberated from 
the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters 
must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells 
down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its 
fellows, so that they rolled back down the building 
and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over 
Harry’s head, so close he felt the force of them blow 
his hair. 

“Let’s move, NOW!” 

Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry 
stooped to seize Fred’s body under the armpits. Percy, 
realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped 
clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching 
low to avoid the curses flying at them from the 
grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way. 

“Here,” said Harry, and they placed him in a niche 
where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not 
bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, 
and after making sure that the body was well hidden, 
he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle 
had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which 
Page | 723 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long 
gone from the windows, he saw many people running 
backward and forward, whether friends or foes he 
could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a 
bull-like roar: “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the 
direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of 
students. 

“Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed. 

She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed 
to be wrestling together, and for one mad second 
Harry thought that they were embracing again; then 
he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to 
stop him running after Percy. 

“Listen to me — LISTEN, ROM” 

“I wanna help — I wanna kill Death Eaters — ” 

His face was contorted, smeared with dust and 
smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief. 

“Ron, we’re the only ones who can end it! Please — 
Ron — we need the snake, we’ve got to kill the snake!” 
said Hermione. 

But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another 
Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; 
he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people 
who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other 
Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, 
that Ginny was not — but he could not permit that 
idea to form in his mind — 

“We will fight!” Hermione said. “We’ll have to, to reach 
the snake! But let’s not lose sight now of what we’re 
supposed to be d-doing! We’re the only ones who can 
end it!” 

Page | 724 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her 
torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took 
great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping 
a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry. 

“You need to find out where Voldemort is, because 
hell have the snake with him, won’t he? Do it, Harry 
— look inside him!” 

Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been 
burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort’s 
thoughts? He closed his eyes on her command, and at 
once, the screams and the bangs and all the 
discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until 
they became distant, as though he stood far, far away 
from them. ... 

He was standing in the middle of a desolate but 
strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the 
walls and all the windows boarded except for one. The 
sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and 
distant. The single unblocked window revealed 
distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but 
inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil 
lamp. 

He was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching 
it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret 
room only he had ever found, the room, like the 
Chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and 
inquisitive to discover. . . . He was confident that the 
boy would not find the diadem . . . although 
Dumbledore’s puppet had come much farther than he 
had ever expected . . . too far. . . . 

“My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked. He 
turned: There was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the 
darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of 
the punishment he had received after the boy’s last 

Page | 725 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. 
“My Lord ... please ... my son ...” 

“If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did 
not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. 
Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?” 

“No — never,” whispered Malfoy. 

“You must hope not.” 

“Aren’t — aren’t you afraid, my Lord, that Potter 
might die at another hand but yours?” asked Malfoy, 
his voice shaking. “Wouldn’t it be ... forgive me ... 
more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, 
and seek him y-yourself?” 

“Do not pretend, Lucius. You wish the battle to cease 
so that you can discover what has happened to your 
son. And I do not need to seek Potter. Before the night 
is out, Potter will have come to find me.” 

Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in 
his fingers. It troubled him ... and those things that 
troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged. ... 

“Go and fetch Snape.” 

“Snape, m-my Lord?” 

“Snape. Now. I need him. There is a — service — I 
require from him. Go.” 

Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, 
Lucius left the room. Voldemort continued to stand 
there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring 
at it. 



Page | 726 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he 
looked around, and there was the great thick snake, 
now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within 
the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, 
a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between 
glittering cage and tank. 

With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; 
at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the 
screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle. 

“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, 
it’s got some sort of magical protection around it. He’s 
just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.” 

“Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said 
Hermione, outraged. “He’s not — he’s not even 
fighting?” 

“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He 
thinks I’m going to go to him.” 

“But why?” 

“He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini 
close beside him — obviously I’m going to have to go 
to him to get near the thing — ” 

“Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you 
can’t go, that’s what he wants, what he’s expecting. 
You stay here and look after Hermione, and I’ll go and 
get it — ” 

Harry cut across Ron. 

“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be 
back as soon as I — ” 



Page | 727 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Hermione, “it makes much more sense if I 
take the Cloak and — ” 

“Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her. 

Before Hermione could get farther than “Ron, I’m just 
as capable — ” the tapestry at the top of the staircase 
on which they stood was ripped open. 

“POTTER!” 

Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even 
before their wands were fully raised, Hermione 
shouted, “Glisseo\” 

The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute 
and she, Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to 
control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters’ 
Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot 
through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and 
spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. 

“Duro\” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the 
tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches 
as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters 
pursuing them crumpled against it. 

“Get back!” shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and 
Hermione flattened themselves against a door as a 
herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded 
by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared 
not to notice them: Her hair had come down and 
there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the 
corner, they heard her scream, “CHARGE!” 

“Harry, you get the Cloak on,” said Hermione. “Never 
mind us — ” 



Page | 728 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




But he threw it over all three of them; large though 
they were, he doubted anyone would see their 
disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the 
air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells. 

They ran down the next staircase and found 
themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits 
on either side of the fighters were crammed with 
figures screaming advice and encouragement, while 
Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled 
students and teachers. Dean had won himself a 
wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati 
with Travers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione raised their 
wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were 
weaving and darting around so much that there was a 
strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if 
they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking 
for the opportunity to act, there came a great 
“Wheeeeeeeeeeee\” and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves 
zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down 
onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly 
engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. 

“Argh!” 

A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; 
the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in 
midair as Ron tried to shake them loose. 

“Someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked Death 
Eater, pointing. 

Dean made the most of the Death Eater’s momentary 
distraction, knocking him out with a Stunning Spell; 
Dolohov attempted to retaliate and Parvati shot a 
Body-Bind Curse at him. 

“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione 
gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and 

Page | 729 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, 
slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the 
top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. 

“I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!” 

Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with 
another masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the 
Death Eater as they passed: Malfoy looked around, 
beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from 
under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the 
Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. 

“And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life 
tonight, you two-faced bastard!” Ron yelled. 

There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the 
hall, Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, 
close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a 
masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside 
them. Students ran in every direction, some carrying 
or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunning 
Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but 
nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere 
brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which 
looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater 
and began reeling him in. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble 
staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the 
Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points 
spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped 
and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the 
balcony overhead as they reached the ground, and a 
gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four- 
legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the 
fallen. 



Page | 730 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“NO!” shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast 
from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown 
backward from the feebly stirring body of Lavender 
Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to 
return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and 
a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he 
crumpled to the ground and did not move. 

“I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over 
the banisters. “More for any who want them! Here — ” 

And with a movement like a tennis serve, she heaved 
another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved 
her wand through the air, and caused the ball to 
speed across the hall and smash through a window. 
At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors 
burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced 
their way into the entrance hall. 

Screams of terror rent the air: The fighters scattered, 
Death Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and 
green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming 
monsters, which shuddered and reared, more 
terrifying than ever. 

“How do we get out?” yelled Ron over all the 
screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione could 
answer they were bowled aside: Hagrid had come 
thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery 
pink umbrella. 

“Don’t hurt ’em, don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled. 

“HAGRID, NO!” 

Harry forgot everything else: He sprinted out from 
under the Cloak, running bent double to avoid the 
curses illuminating the whole hall. 



Page | 731 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“HAGRID, COME BACK!” 



But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it 
happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and 
with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, 
they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid 
buried in their midst. 

“HAGRID!” 

Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether 
friend or foe he did not care: He was sprinting down 
the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders 
were swarming away with their prey, and he could see 
nothing of Hagrid at all. 

“HAGRID!” 

He thought he could make out an enormous arm 
waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he 
made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a 
monumental foot, which swung down out of the 
darkness and made the ground on which he stood 
shudder. He looked up: A giant stood before him, 
twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing 
but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from 
the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it 
smashed a massive fist through an upper window, 
and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back 
under the shelter of the doorway. 

“Oh my — !” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron 
caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the giant 
now trying to seize people through the window above. 

“DONT!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as 
she raised her wand. “Stun him and hell crush half 
the castle — ” 

Page | 732 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“HAGGER?” 



Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; 
only now did Harry realize that Grawp was, indeed, 
an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster trying 
to crush people on the upper floors looked around 
and let out a roar. The stone steps trembled as he 
stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp ’s 
lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick- 
sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at 
each other with the savagery of lions. 

“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous 
yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized 
Hermione’s hand and tore down the steps into the 
grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost 
hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that 
they were halfway toward the forest before they were 
brought up short again. 

The air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath 
caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved out 
in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated 
blackness, moving in a great wave toward the castle, 
their faces hooded and their breath rattling. . . . 

Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the 
sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, 
deadened, because a silence only dementors could 
bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred 
was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already 
dead. ... 

“Come on, Harry!” said Hermione’s voice from a very 
long way away. “Patronuses, Harry, come on!” 

He raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was 
spreading through him: How many more lay dead 



Page | 733 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




that he did not yet know about; he felt as though his 
soul had already half left his body. . . . 



“HARRY, COME ON!” screamed Hermione. 

A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward 

them, sucking their way closer to Harry’s despair, 
which was like a promise of a feast. ... 

He saw Ron’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker 
feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione’s otter twist in 
midair and fade; and his own wand trembled in his 
hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming 
oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling. . . . 

And then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s heads: The dementors 
fell back before the creatures’ approach. Three more 
people had arrived out of the darkness to stand 
beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to 
cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. 

“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they 
were back in the Room of Requirement and this was 
simply spell practice for the D.A. “That’s right, Harry 
... come on, think of something happy. ...” 

“Something happy?” he said, his voice cracked. 

“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we’re still 
fighting. Come on, now. ...” 

There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and 

then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him, the 
stag burst from the end of Harry’s wand. It cantered 
forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, 
and immediately the night was mild again, but the 
sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his 
ears.

“Can’t thank you enough,” said Ron shakily, turning 
to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus, “you just saved — ” 

With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another 
giant came lurching out of the darkness from the 
direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than 
any of them. 

“RUN!” Harry shouted again, but the others needed 
no telling: They all scattered, and not a second too 
soon, for next moment the creature’s vast foot had 
fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry 
looked round: Ron and Hermione were following him, 
but the other three had vanished back into the battle. 

“Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung 
its club again and its bellows echoed through the 
night, across the grounds where bursts of red and 
green light continued to illuminate the darkness. 

“The Whomping Willow,” said Harry, “go!” 

Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it 
into a small space into which he could not look now: 
Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the 
people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, 
must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach 
the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as 
Hermione said, the only way to end it — 

He sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death 
itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness 
all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing 
like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest 
though the night was windless; through grounds that 
seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran 
faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was 
he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that 



Page | 735 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, 
slashing branches. 



Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the 
Willow’s swiping branches, peering through the 
darkness toward its thick trunk, trying to see the 
single knot in the bark of the old tree that would 
paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione 
so out of breath she could not speak. 

“How — how’re we going to get in?” panted Ron. “I can 
— see the place — if we just had — Crookshanks 
again — ” 

“Crookshanks?” wheezed Hermione, bent double, 
clutching her chest. “Are you a wizard, or what?” 

“Oh — right — yeah — ” 

Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig 
on the ground and said, “Wingardium Leviosal” The 
twig flew up from the ground, spun through the air as 
if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at 
the trunk through the Willow’s ominously swaying 
branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at 
once, the writhing tree became still. 

“Perfect!” panted Hermione. 

“Wait.” 

For one teetering second, while the crashes and 
booms of the battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. 
Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to 
come. ... Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a 
trap? 

But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel 
and plain: The only way forward was to kill the snake, 

Page | 736 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and the snake was where Voldemort was, and 
Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. ... 



“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, 
pushing him forward. 

Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the 
tree’s roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had 
been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was 
low-ceilinged: They had had to double up to move 
through it nearly four years previously; now there was 
nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand 
illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet 
barriers, but none came. They moved in silence, 
Harry’s gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the 
wand held in his fist. 

At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry 
saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his 
ankle. 

“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!” 

He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of 
slippery cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he 
dragged it over himself, murmured, “Nox,” 
extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his 
hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his 
senses straining, expecting every second to be 
discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of 
green light. 

And then he heard voices coming from the room 
directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled by the 
fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had 
been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. 
Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the 
opening and peered through a tiny gap left between 
crate and wall. 

Page | 737 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see 
Nagini, swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, 
safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated 
unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a 
table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a 
wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry’s heart lurched: 
Snape was inches away from where he crouched, 
hidden. 

"... my Lord, their resistance is crumbling — ” 

“ — and it is doing so without your help,” said 
Voldemort in his high, clear voice. “Skilled wizard 
though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make 
much difference now. We are almost there ... almost.” 

“Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I 
can find him, my Lord. Please.” 

Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a 
little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering 
whether there was any spell that might penetrate the 
protection surrounding her, but he could not think of 
anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away 
his position. ... 

Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the 
red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of 
him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. 

“I have a problem, Severus,” said Voldemort softly. 

“My Lord?” said Snape. 

Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as 
delicately and precisely as a conductor’s baton. 

“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?” 



Page | 738 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake 
hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled — or was it 
Voldemort’s sibilant sigh lingering on the air? 

“My — my Lord?” said Snape blankly. “I do not 
understand. You — you have performed extraordinary 
magic with that wand.” 

“No,” said Voldemort. “I have performed my usual 
magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand ... no. It has 
not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no 
difference between this wand and the one I procured 
from Ollivander all those years ago.” 

Voldemort’s tone was musing, calm, but Harry’s scar 
had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in 
his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense 
of fury building inside Voldemort. 

“No difference,” said Voldemort again. 

Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face: He 
wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying 
to find the right words to reassure his master. 

Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry 
lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking 
in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury 
mounted in Harry. 

“I have thought long and hard, Severus. ... Do you 
know why I have called you back from the battle?” 

And for a moment Harry saw Snape ’s profile: His eyes 
were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted 
cage. 

“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me 
find Potter.” 

Page | 739 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands 
Potter as I do. He does not need finding. Potter will 
come to me. I know his weakness, you see, his one 
great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck 
down around him, knowing that it is for him that it 
happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will 
come.” 

“But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by one 
other than yourself — ” 

“My instructions to my Death Eaters have been 
perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends — the 
more, the better — but do not kill him. 

“But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not 
Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very 
valuable.” 

“My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But — let 
me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to 
you. I know I can — ” 

“I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry 
caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again, 
and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of 
a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s impatience in his 
burning scar. “My concern at the moment, Severus, is 
what will happen when I finally meet the boy!” 

“My Lord, there can be no question, surely — ?” 

“ — but there is a question, Severus. There is.” 

Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly 
again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white 
fingers, staring at Snape. 



Page | 740 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Why did both the wands I have used fail when 
directed at Harry Potter?” 

“I — I cannot answer that, my Lord.” 

“Can’t you?” 

The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through 
Harry’s head: He forced his own fist into his mouth to 
stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his 
eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into 
Snape’s pale face. 

“My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, 
Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. 
Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, 
told me to take another’s wand. I did so, but Lucius’s 
wand shattered upon meeting Potter’s.” 

“I — I have no explanation, my Lord.” 

Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark 
eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its 
protective sphere. 

“I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the 
Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its 
previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus 
Dumbledore.” 

And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s 
face was like a death mask. It was marble white and 
so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that 
anyone lived behind the blank eyes. 

“My Lord — let me go to the boy — ” 

“All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, 

I have sat here,” said Voldemort, his voice barely 

Page | 741 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering, why 
the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, 
refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for 
its rightful owner ... and I think I have the answer.” 

Snape did not speak. 

“Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, 
after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful 
servant, and I regret what must happen.” 

“My Lord — ” 

“The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, 
because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand 
belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You 
killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the 
Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.” 

“My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand. 

“It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must 
master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I 
master Potter at last.” 

And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It 
did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed 
to think he had been reprieved: But then Voldemort’s 
intention became clear. The snake’s cage was rolling 
through the air, and before Snape could do anything 
more than yell, it had encased him, head and 
shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. 

“Kill.” 

There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape ’s face 
losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his 
black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his 



Page | 742 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off 
himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. 

“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly. 

He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no 
remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take 
charge, with a wand that would now do his full 
bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the 
snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell 
sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the 
wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room 
without a backward glance, and the great serpent 
floated after him in its huge protective sphere. 

Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened 
his eyes: He had drawn blood biting down on his 
knuckles in the effort not to shout out. Now he was 
looking through the tiny crack between crate and 
wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the 
floor. 

“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had 
already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his 
view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways 
silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up 
into the room. 

He did not know why he was doing it, why he was 
approaching the dying man: He did not know what he 
felt as he saw Snape’s white face, and the fingers 
trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. 

Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down 
upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes 
found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over 
him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and 
pulled him close. 



Page | 743 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s 
throat. 

“Take ... it. ... Take ... it. ...” 

Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. 
Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his 
mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew 
what it was, but did not know what to do — 

A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his 
shaking hands by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery 
substance into it with his wand. When the flask was 
full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there 
was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes 
slackened. 

“Look ... at ... me. ...” he whispered. 

The green eyes found the black, but after a second, 
something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to 
vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and empty. The 
hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape 
moved no more. 



Page | 744 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE PRINCE’S TALE 

Harry remained kneeling at Snape’s side, simply 
staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold 
voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his 
feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking 
that Voldemort had reentered the room. 

Voldemort ’s voice reverberated from the walls and 
floor, and Harry realized that he was talking to 
Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the 
residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in 
the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood 
beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a 
deathblow away. 

“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, 

“valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value 
bravery. 

“Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue 
to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish 
this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is 
a loss and a waste. 

Page | 745 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to 
retreat immediately. 



“You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with 
dignity. Treat your injured. 

“I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have 
permitted your friends to die for you rather than face 
me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden 
Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come 
to me, have not given yourself up, then battle 
recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, 
Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish 
every last man, woman, and child who has tried to 
conceal you from me. One hour.” 

Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, 
looking at Harry. 

“Don’t listen to him,” said Ron. 

“It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly. “Let’s — let’s 
get back to the castle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll 
need to think of a new plan — ” 

She glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to 
the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered 
up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. 
He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way 
Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it 
had been done. ... 

They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them 
talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron and 
Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their 
heads, as he could. 



Page | 746 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




You have permitted your friends to die for you rather 
than face me yourself I shall wait for one hour in the 
Forbidden Forest. . . . One hour. . . . 

Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of 
the castle. It could only be an hour or so from dawn, 
yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried 
toward the stone steps. A lone clog, the size of a small 
boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no 
other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. 

The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no 
flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. 
The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were 
stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all 
over the floor, along with pieces of marble and 
splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown 
away. 

“Where is everyone?” whispered Hermione. 

Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in 
the doorway. 

The House tables were gone and the room was 
crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their arms 
around each other’s necks. The injured were being 
treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey 
and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the 
injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where 
he lay, unable to stand. 

The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry 
could not see Fred’s body, because his family 
surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; 
Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her body 
shaking, Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears 
cascaded down his cheeks. 



Page | 747 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked 
away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose 
face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron 
joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm 
around Ron’s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione 
moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a 
clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and 
Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently 
asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. 

The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, 
shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. 
He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look 
at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died 
for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could 
not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself 
up in the first place, Fred might never have died. ... 

He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. 
Lupin, Tonks ... He yearned not to feel. ... He wished 
he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything 
that was screaming inside him. ... 

The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts 
seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the 
Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the 
crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not 
slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle 
guarding the headmaster’s office. 

“Password?” 

“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because 
it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise 
the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase 
behind. 

But when Harry burst into the circular office he found 
a change. The portraits that hung all around the 

Page | 748 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or 
headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had 
flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined 
the castle, so that they could have a clear view of 
what was going on. 

Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted 
frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s 
chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve 
lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry 
heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape’s memories 
into the wide basin with its runic markings around 
the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would 
be a blessed relief. ... Nothing that even Snape had 
left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The 
memories swirled, silver white and strange, and 
without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless 
abandonment, as though this would assuage his 
torturing grief, Harry dived. 

He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found 
warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that 
he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge 
chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls 
were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny 
boy was watching them from behind a clump of 
bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes 
were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too 
short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have 
belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. 

Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more 
than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. 
There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he 
watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher 
and higher than her sister. 

“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two. 



Page | 749 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height 
of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, 
launched herself skyward with a great shout of 
laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground 
asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the 
air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. 

“Mummy told you not to!” 

Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of 
her sandals on the ground, making a crunching, 
grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. 

“Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!” 

“But I’m fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at 
this. Watch what I can do.” 

Petunia glanced around. The playground was 
deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls 
did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen 
flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. 
Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity 
and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near 
enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. 
The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, 
like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster. 

“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia. 

“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her 
hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground. 

“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had 
followed the flower’s flight to the ground and lingered 
upon it. “How do you do it?” she added, and there 
was definite longing in her voice. 



Page | 750 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Snape could no longer contain 
himself, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. 
Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the 
swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained 
where she was. Snape seemed to regret his 
appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow 
cheeks as he looked at Lily. 

“What’s obvious?” asked Lily. 

Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a 
glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the 
swings, he lowered his voice and said, “I know what 
you are.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“You’re ... you’re a witch,” whispered Snape. 

She looked affronted. 

“ That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!” 

She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward 
her sister. 

“No!” said Snape. He was highly colored now, and 
Harry wondered why he did not take off the 
ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did 
not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He flapped 
after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his 
older self. 

The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, 
both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it 
was the safe place in tag. 



Page | 751 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You are,” said Snape to Lily. “You are a witch. I’ve 
been watching you for a while. But there’s nothing 
wrong with that. My mum’s one, and I’m a wizard.” 

Petunia’s laugh was like cold water. 

“Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now 
that she had recovered from the shock of his 
unexpected appearance. “I know who you are. You’re 
that Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s End by the 
river,” she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone 
that she considered the address a poor 
recommendation. “Why have you been spying on us?” 

“Haven’t been spying,” said Snape, hot and 
uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. 
“Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,” he added spitefully, 

“ you’re a Muggle.” 

Though Petunia evidently did not understand the 
word, she could hardly mistake the tone. 

“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. Lily 
obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. 
He stood watching them as they marched through the 
playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to 
observe him, recognized Snape ’s bitter 
disappointment, and understood that Snape had been 
planning this moment for a while, and that it had all 
gone wrong. . . . 

The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re- 
formed around him. He was now in a small thicket of 
trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through 
their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a 
basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing 
each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had 
removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less 
peculiar in the half light. 

Page | 752 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




"... and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic 
outside school, you get letters.” 

“But I have done magic outside school!” 

“We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let 
you off when you’re a kid and you can’t help it. But 
once you’re eleven,” he nodded importantly, “and they 
start training you, then you’ve got to go careful.” 

There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen 
twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she 
was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she 
dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, 
“It is real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re 
lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It is 
real, isn’t it?” 

“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get 
the letter, you and me.” 

“Really?” whispered Lily. 

“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut 
hair and his odd clothes, he struck an oddly 
impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of 
confidence in his destiny. 

“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered. 

“Normally,” said Snape. “But you’re Muggle-born, so 
someone from the school will have to come and 
explain to your parents.” 

“Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?” 

Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish 
gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair.

“No,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference.” 

“Good,” said Lily, relaxing: It was clear that she had 
been worrying. 

“You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape. “I saw that. 
All the time I was watching you ...” 

His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had 
stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up 
at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as 
greedily as he had watched her in the playground. 

“How are things at your house?” Lily asked. 

A little crease appeared between his eyes. 

“Fine,” he said. 

“They’re not arguing anymore?” 

“Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a 
fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, 
apparently unaware of what he was doing. “But it 
won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.” 

“Doesn’t your dad like magic?” 

“He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape. 

“Severus?” 

A little smile twisted Snape ’s mouth when she said 
his name. 

“Yeah?” 

“Tell me about the dementors again.” 



Page | 754 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What d’you want to know about them for?” 

“If I use magic outside school — ” 

“They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! 
Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff. 
They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You’re not 
going to end up in Azkaban, you’re too — ” 

He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then 
a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: 
Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. 

“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, 
but Snape had jumped to his feet. 

“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?” 

Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. 
Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful 
to say. 

“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, 
pointing at Snape’s chest. “Your mum’s blouse?” 

There was a crack: A branch over Petunia’s head had 
fallen. Lily screamed: The branch caught Petunia on 
the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst 
into tears. 

“Tuney!” 

But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on 
Snape. 

“Did you make that happen?” 

“No.” He looked both defiant and scared. 



Page | 755 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You did). 
You hurt her!” 



“No — no I didn’t!” 

But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last 
burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after 
her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused. 



And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around: He 
was on platform nine and three-quarters, and Snape 
stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, 
sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly 
resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four 
a short distance away. The two girls stood a little 
apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading 
with her sister; Harry moved closer to listen. 

"... I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! Listen — ” She caught 
her sister’s hand and held tight to it, even though 
Petunia tried to pull it away. “Maybe once I’m there — 
no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I’m there, I’ll be able to 
go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to 
change his mind!” 

“I don’t — want — to — go!” said Petunia, and she 
dragged her hand back out of her sister’s grasp. “You 
think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to 
be a — a — ” 

Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats 
mewling in their owners’ arms, over the owls 
fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the 
students, some already in their long black robes, 
loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else 
greeting one another with glad cries after a summer 
apart. 

Page | 756 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ — you think I want to be a — a freak?” 

Lily’s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in 
tugging her hand away. 

“I’m not a freak,” said Lily. “That’s a horrible thing to 
say.” 

“That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish. 
“A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy 
... weirdos, that’s what you two are. It’s good you’re 
being separated from normal people. It’s for our 
safety.” 

Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking 
around the platform with an air of wholehearted 
enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked 
back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce. 

“You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when 
you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take 
you.” 

Petunia turned scarlet. 

“Beg? I didn’t beg!” 

“I saw his reply. It was very kind.” 

“You shouldn’t have read — ” whispered Petunia, “that 
was my private — how could you — ?” 

Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where 
Snape stood nearby. Petunia gasped. 

“That boy found it! You and that boy have been 
sneaking in my room!” 



Page | 757 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No — not sneaking — ” Now Lily was on the 
defensive. “Severus saw the envelope, and he couldn’t 
believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, 
that’s all! He says there must be wizards working 
undercover in the postal service who take care of — ” 

“Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” 
said Petunia, now as pale as she had been flushed. 

“ Freak).” she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to 
where her parents stood. ... 

The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along 
the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered 
through the countryside. He had already changed into 
his school robes, had perhaps taken the first 
opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At 
last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a 
group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a 
corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face 
pressed against the windowpane. 

Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down 
opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then looked 
back out of the window. She had been crying. 

“I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted 
voice. 

“Why not?” 

“Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from 
Dumbledore.” 

“So what?” 

She threw him a look of deep dislike. 

“So she’s my sister!” 



Page | 758 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“She’s only a — ” He caught himself quickly; Lily, too 
busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, 
did not hear him. 

“But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the 
exhilaration in his voice. “This is it! We’re off to 
Hogwarts!” 

She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, 
she half smiled. 

“You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged 
that she had brightened a little. 

“Slytherin?” 

One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had 
shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that 
point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose 
attention had been focused entirely on the two beside 
the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like 
Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been 
well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so 
conspicuously lacked. 

“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, 
wouldn’t you?” James asked the boy lounging on the 
seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized 
that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. 

“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said. 

“Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all 
right!” 

Sirius grinned. 

“Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you 
heading, if you’ve got the choice?” 

Page | 759 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




James lifted an invisible sword. 



“ ‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my 
dad.” 

Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned 
on him. 

“Got a problem with that?” 

“No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said 
otherwise. “If you’d rather be brawny than brainy — ” 

“Where ’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” 
interjected Sirius. 

James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather 
flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike. 

“Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.” 

“Oooooo ...” 

James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried 
to trip Snape as he passed. 

“See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the 
compartment door slammed. ... 

And the scene dissolved once more. ... 

Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced 
the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces. Then 
Professor McGonagall said, “Evans, Lily!” 

He watched his mother walk forward on trembling 
legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. Professor 
McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, 



Page | 760 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and barely a second after it had touched the dark red 
hair, the hat cried, “ Gryffindoii” 



Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off 
the hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then 
hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she 
went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad 
little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the 
bench to make room for her. She took one look at 
him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded 
her arms, and firmly turned her back on him. 

The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, 
Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at the 
Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students 
remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called 
Snape. 

Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him 
place the hat upon his head. “Slytherinl” cried the 
Sorting Hat. 

And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the 
Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were 
cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge 
gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as 
he sat down beside him. ... 

And the scene changed. ... 

Lily and Snape were walking across the castle 
courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch 
up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he 
realized how much taller they both were: A few years 
seemed to have passed since their Sorting. 

"... thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape 
was saying. “Best friends?” 

Page | 761 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re 
hanging round with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and 
Mulciber! Mulciber\ What do you see in him, Sev, he’s 
creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary 
Macdonald the other day?” 

Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, 
looking up into the thin, sallow face. 

“That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, 
that’s all — ” 

“It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny — ” 

“What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up 
to?” demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said 
it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment. 

“What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily. 

“They sneak out at night. There’s something weird 
about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?” 

“He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s ill — ” 

“Every month at the full moon?” said Snape. 

“I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. 
“Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do 
you care what they’re doing at night?” 

“I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful 
as everyone seems to think they are.” 

The intensity of his gaze made her blush. 

“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped 
her voice. “And you’re being really ungrateful. I heard 
what happened the other night. You went sneaking 

Page | 762 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and 
James Potter saved you from whatever’s down there 



Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, 
“Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? 

He was saving his neck and his friends’ too! You’re 
not going to — I won’t let you — ” 

“Let me? Let me?” 

Lily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked 
at once. 

“I didn’t mean — I just don’t want to see you made a 
fool of — He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!” 
The words seemed wrenched from him against his 
will. “And he’s not ... everyone thinks ... big Quidditch 
hero — ” Snape’s bitterness and dislike were rendering 
him incoherent, and Lily’s eyebrows were traveling 
farther and farther up her forehead. 

“I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said, 
cutting across Snape. “I don’t need you to tell me 
that. But Mulciber’s and Avery’s idea of humor is just 
evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how you can be 
friends with them.” 

Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her 
strictures on Mulciber and Avery. The moment she 
had insulted James Potter, his whole body had 
relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new 
spring in Snape’s step. ... 

And the scene dissolved. ... 

Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after 
sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, 
watched as he wandered away from the castle and 

Page | 763 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the 
beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew 
sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, 
because he knew what happened after James had 
hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he 
knew what had been done and said, and it gave him 
no pleasure to hear it again. ... He watched as Lily 
joined the group and went to Snape’s defense. 
Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his 
humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: 
“MudbloocL.” 

The scene changed. ... 

“I’m sorry.” 

“I’m not interested.” 

“I’m sorry!” 

“Save your breath.” 

It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing 
gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the 
portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor 
Tower. 

“I only came out because Mary told me you were 
threatening to sleep here.” 

“I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you 
Mudblood, it just — ” 

“Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s 
too late. I’ve made excuses for you for years. None of 
my friends can understand why I even talk to you. 
You and your precious little Death Eater friends — 
you see, you don’t even deny it! You don’t even deny 



Page | 764 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




that’s what you’re all aiming to be! You can’t wait to 
join You- Know- Who, can you?” 

He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking. 

“I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, 

I’ve chosen mine.” 

“No — listen, I didn’t mean — ” 

“ — to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my 
birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any 
different?” 

He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a 
contemptuous look she turned and climbed back 
through the portrait hole. ... 

The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little 
longer to reform: Harry seemed to fly through shifting 
shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified 
again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in 
the darkness, the wind whistling through the 
branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was 
panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly 
in his hand, waiting for something or for someone. ... 
His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that 
he could not be harmed, and he looked over his 
shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was 
waiting for — 

Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through 
the air: Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had 
dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of 
his hand. 

“Don’t kill me!” 

“That was not my intention.” 

Page | 765 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been 
drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. 

He stood before Snape with his robes whipping 
around him, and his face was illuminated from below 
in the light cast by his wand. 

“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort 
have for me?” 

“No — no message — I’m here on my own account!” 

Snape was wringing his hands: He looked a little 
mad, with his straggling black hair flying around him. 

“I — I come with a warning — no, a request — please 



Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and 
branches still flew through the night air around them, 
silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced 
each other. 

“What request could a Death Eater make of me?” 

“The — the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney 



“Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay 
to Lord Voldemort?” 

“Everything — everything I heard!” said Snape. “That 
is why — it is for that reason — he thinks it means 
Lily Evans!” 

“The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said 
Dumbledore. “It spoke of a boy born at the end of 
July — ” 



Page | 766 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, 
he is going to hunt her down — kill them all — ” 

“If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, 
“surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not 
ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the 
son?” 

“I have — I have asked him — ” 

“You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had 
never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape 
seemed to shrink a little. “You do not care, then, 
about the deaths of her husband and child? They can 
die, as long as you have what you want?” 

Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at 
Dumbledore. 

“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her — them 
— safe. Please.” 

“And what will you give me in return, Severus?” 

“In — in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and 
Harry expected him to protest, but after a long 
moment he said, “Anything.” 

The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s 
office, and something was making a terrible sound, 
like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward 
in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, 
looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his 
face, and he looked like a man who had lived a 
hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop. 

“I thought ... you were going ... to keep her ... safe. 



Page | 767 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” 
said Dumbledore. “Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t 
you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?” 

Snape’s breathing was shallow. 

“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore. 

With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off 
an irksome fly. 

“Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. 

You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans’s 
eyes, I am sure?” 

“DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone ... dead ...” 

“Is this remorse, Severus?” 

“I wish ... I wish / were dead. ...” 

“And what use would that be to anyone?” said 
Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you 
truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.” 

Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and 
Dumbledore ’s words appeared to take a long time to 
reach him. 

“What — what do you mean?” 

“You know how and why she died. Make sure it was 
not in vain. Help me protect Lily’s son.” 

“He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone 



“The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in 
terrible danger when he does.” 

Page | 768 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained 
control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At 
last he said, “Very well. Very well. But never — never 
tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I 
cannot bear . . . especially Potter’s son ... I want your 
word!” 

“My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best 
of you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into 
Snape’s ferocious, anguished face. “If you insist ...” 

The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape 
was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore. 

“ — mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined 
rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, 
attention-seeking and impertinent — ” 

“You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said 
Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of 
Transfiguration Today. “Other teachers report that the 
boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. 
Personally, I find him an engaging child.” 

Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking 
up, “Keep an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?” 

A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and 
Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the 
entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule 
Ball passed them on their way to bed. 

“Well?” murmured Dumbledore. 

“Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is 
panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much 
help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.” 
Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore ’s crooked- 



P a g e | 769 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




nosed profile. “Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark 
burns.” 

“Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour 
and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. 
“And are you tempted to join him?” 

“No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and 
Roger’s retreating figures. “I am not such a coward.” 

“No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by 
far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think 
we Sort too soon. ...” 

He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken. ... 

And now Harry stood in the headmaster’s office yet 
again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged 
sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, 
apparently semiconscious. His right hand dangled 
over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was 
muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the 
wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a 
goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore ’s 
throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore ’s eyelids 
fluttered and opened. 

“Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “ why did you 
put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely you 
realized that. Why even touch it?” 

Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before 
Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor 
lay beside it. 

Dumbledore grimaced. 

“I ... was a fool. Sorely tempted ...” 



Page | 770 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Tempted by what?” 
Dumbledore did not answer. 



“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape 
sounded furious. “That ring carried a curse of 
extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope 
for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time 
being — ” 

Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and 
examined it with the expression of one being shown 
an interesting curio. 

“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you 
think I have?” 

Dumbledore ’s tone was conversational; he might have 
been asking for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, 
and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is 
no halting such a spell forever. It will spread 
eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over 
time.” 

Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a 
year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to 
him. 

“I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, 
Severus.” 

“If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might 
have been able to do more, buy you more time!” said 
Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring 
and the sword. “Did you think that breaking the ring 
would break the curse?” 

“Something like that ... I was delirious, no doubt. ...” 
said Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened 

Page | 771 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




himself in his chair. “Well, really, this makes matters 
much more straightforward.” 

Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled. 

“I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around 
me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.” 

Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often 
occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. Harry 
could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject 
of Dumbledore ’s cursed hand, but the other held it up 
in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. 
Scowling, Snape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect 
Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for 
Lucius’s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco’s 
parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.” 

“In short, the boy has had a death sentence 
pronounced upon him as surely as I have,” said 
Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought the natural 
successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?” 

There was a short pause. 

“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.” 

“Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future 
when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?” 

“He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.” 

“And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, 
almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that 
you will do all in your power to protect the students of 
Hogwarts?” 

Snape gave a stiff nod. 



Page | 772 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover 
what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a 
danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help 
and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you — ” 

“ — much less since his father has lost favor. Draco 
blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius’s 
position.” 

“All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than 
for accidental victims of whatever schemes might 
occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only 
one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord 
Voldemort’s wrath.” 

Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic 
as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?” 

“Certainly not. You must kill me.” 

There was a long silence, broken only by an odd 
clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit 
of cuttlebone. 

“Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his 
voice heavy with irony. “Or would you like a few 
moments to compose an epitaph?” 

“Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I 
daresay the moment will present itself in due course. 
Given what has happened tonight,” he indicated his 
withered hand, “we can be sure that it will happen 
within a year.” 

“If you don’t mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why 
not let Draco do it?” 



Page | 773 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said 
Dumbledore. “I would not have it ripped apart on my 
account.” 

“And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?” 

“You alone know whether it will harm your soul to 
help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,” said 
Dumbledore. “I ask this one great favor of you, 
Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as 
the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year’s 
league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit 
to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for 
instance, Greyback is involved — I hear Voldemort 
has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to 
play with her food before she eats it.” 

His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as 
they had frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul 
they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave 
another curt nod. 

Dumbledore seemed satisfied. 

“Thank you, Severus ...” 

The office disappeared, and now Snape and 
Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted 
castle grounds by twilight. 

“What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings 
you are closeted together?” Snape asked abruptly. 

Dumbledore looked weary. 

“Why? You aren’t trying to give him more detentions, 
Severus? The boy will soon have spent more time in 
detention than out.” 



Page | 774 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“He is his father over again — ” 

“In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much 
more like his mother’s. I spend time with Harry 
because I have things to discuss with him, 
information I must give him before it is too late.” 

“Information,” repeated Snape. “You trust him ... you 
do not trust me.” 

“It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, 
limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough 
information for him to do what he needs to do.” 

“And why may I not have the same information?” 

“I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, 
particularly not a basket that spends so much time 
dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.” 

“Which I do on your orders!” 

“And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I 
underestimate the constant danger in which you 
place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what 
appears to be valuable information while withholding 
the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but 
you.” 

“Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable 
of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who 
has a direct connection into the Dark Lord’s mind!” 

“Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore. 
“Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly 
sharing Harry’s mind means to him. It was pain such 
as he has never experienced. He will not try to 
possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.” 



Page | 775 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t understand.” 



“Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear 
close contact with a soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue 
on frozen steel, like flesh in flame — ” 

“Souls? We were talking of minds!” 

“In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of 
one is to speak of the other.” 

Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they 
were alone. They were close by the Forbidden Forest 
now, but there was no sign of anyone near them. 

“After you have killed me, Severus — ” 

“You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that 
small service of me!” snarled Snape, and real anger 
flared in the thin face now. “You take a great deal for 
granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my 
mind!” 

“You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are 
talking about services you owe me, I thought you 
agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin 
friend?” 

Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed. 

“Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and 
you shall not complain that I have no confidence in 
you. ...” 

They were back in Dumbledore ’s office, the windows 
dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, 
as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. 



Page | 776 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not 
until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the 
strength to do what must be done?” 

“But what must he do?” 

“That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, 
Severus. There will come a time — after my death — 
do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time 
when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of 
his snake.” 

“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished. 

“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort 
stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but 
keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, 
then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.” 

“Tell him what?” 

Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. 

“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill 
him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a 
shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord 
Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was 
blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto 
the only living soul left in that collapsing building. 

Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is 
that which gives him the power of speech with 
snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort’s mind 
that he has never understood. And while that 
fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains 
attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort 
cannot die.” 



Page | 777 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one 
end of a long tunnel, they were so far away from him, 
their voices echoing strangely in his ears. 

“So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite 
calmly. 

“And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is 
essential.” 

Another long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought ... 
all these years . . . that we were protecting him for her. 
For Lily.” 

“We have protected him because it has been essential 
to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” 
said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. 

“Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever 
stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have 
thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will 
have arranged matters so that when he does set out 
to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of 
Voldemort.” 

Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified. 

“You have kept him alive so that he can die at the 
right moment?” 

“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and 
women have you watched die?” 

“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said 
Snape. He stood up. “You have used me.” 

“Meaning?” 

“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in 
mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be 

Page | 778 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you tell me you 
have been raising him like a pig for slaughter — ” 

“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore 
seriously. “Have you grown to care for the boy, after 
all?” 

“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronuml” 

From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She 
landed on the office floor, bounded once across the 
office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore 
watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded 
he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of 
tears. 

“After all this time?” 

“Always,” said Snape. 

And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking 
to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk. 

“You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of 
Harry’s departure from his aunt and uncle’s,” said 
Dumbledore. “Not to do so will raise suspicion, when 
Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, 
you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought 
to ensure Harry’s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus 
Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part 
in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly. ... 

I am counting upon you to remain in Lord 
Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or 
Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows. ...” 

Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an 
unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus ’s face looking 
curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. 



Page | 779 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape 
murmured, “that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. 
Identical Potters. It is the only thing that might work. 
You will forget that I have suggested this. You will 
present it as your own idea. You understand?” 

“I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes 
unfocused. ... 

Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a 
broomstick through a clear dark night: He was 
accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and 
ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. 
... A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised 
his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back — 

“ Sectumsemprcd” shouted Snape. 

But the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand 
hand, missed and hit George instead — 

And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old 
bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his 
hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The 
second page carried only a few words: 

could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. 

I think her mind’s going, personally! 

Lots of love, 

Lily 

Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her 
love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in 
two the photograph he was also holding, so that he 
kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the 
portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, 
under the chest of drawers. ... 

Page | 780 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s 
study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his 
portrait. 

“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! 
The Mudblood — ” 

“Do not use that word!” 

“ — the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she 
opened her bag and I heard her!” 

“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore 
behind the headmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the 
sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under 
conditions of need and valor — and he must not know 
that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s 
mind and see you acting for him — ” 

“I know,” said Snape curtly. He approached the 
portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It 
swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it 
from which he took the sword of Gryffindor. 

“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so 
important to give Potter the sword?” said Snape as he 
swung a traveling cloak over his robes. 

“No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “He 
will know what to do with it. And Severus, be very 
careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance 
after George Weasley’s mishap — ” 

Snape turned at the door. 

“Don’t worry, Dumbledore,” he said coolly. “I have a 
plan. ...” 



Page | 781 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the 
Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted 
floor in exactly the same room: Snape might just have 
closed the door. 



Page | 782 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE FOREST AGAIN 

Finally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the 
dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought 
he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry 
understood at last that he was not supposed to 
survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death’s 
welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of 
Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at 
last he flung himself across Voldemort’s path, and did 
not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be 
clean, and the job that ought to have been done in 
Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, 
neither could survive. 

He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How 
strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the 
harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have 
to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How 
many would there be time for, as he rose and walked 
through the castle for the last time, out into the 
grounds and into the forest? 



Page | 783 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with 
that funeral drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt 
to die? All those times he had thought that it was 
about to happen and escaped, he had never really 
thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always 
been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it 
did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun 
Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was 
left was the thing itself: dying. 

If he could only have died on that summer’s night 
when he had left number four, Privet Drive, for the 
last time, when the noble phoenix-feather wand had 
saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so 
quickly he would not have known it had happened! 

Or if he could have launched himself in front of a 
wand to save someone he loved. ... He envied even his 
parents’ deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his 
own destruction would require a different kind of 
bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and 
made an effort to control them, although no one could 
see him; the portraits on the walls were all empty. 

Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt 
more alive and more aware of his own living body 
than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what 
a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding 
heart? It would all be gone ... or at least, he would be 
gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his 
mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were 
his eyes. 

Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course 
there had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been 
too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had 
never questioned his own assumption that 
Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his 
life span had always been determined by how long it 
took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had 
Page | 784 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




passed the job of destroying them to him, and 
obediently he had continued to chip away at the 
bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! 
How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, 
but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had 
already been marked for slaughter, and whose death 
would not be a calamity, but another blow against 
Voldemort. 

And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not 
duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even 
though it was his end, because he had taken trouble 
to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumbledore knew, as 
Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else 
die for him now that he had discovered it was in his 
power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and 
Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way 
back into his mind’s eye, and for a moment he could 
hardly breathe: Death was impatient. ... 

But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had 
failed: The snake survived. One Horcrux remained to 
bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had 
been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for 
somebody. He wondered who would do it. ... Ron and 
Hermione would know what needed to be done, of 
course. ... That would have been why Dumbledore 
wanted him to confide in two others ... so that if he 
fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry 
on. ... 

Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered 
against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth, 
which was that he must die. I must die. It must end. 

Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far- 
off country; he felt as though he had parted from 
them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no 
explanations, he was determined of that. This was a 

Page | 785 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




journey they could not take together, and the 
attempts they would make to stop him would waste 
valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold 
watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. 
Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his 
surrender had elapsed. 

He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs 
like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time 
left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime’s 
beats before the end. He did not look back as he 
closed the office door. 

The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through 
it alone, as if he had already died. The portrait people 
were still missing from their frames; the whole place 
was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were 
concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and 
the mourners were crammed. 

Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and 
descended through the floors, at last walking down 
the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps 
some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, 
to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, 
impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors 
easily. 

Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half 
of a pair that was carrying a body in from the 
grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull 
blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, 
must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and 
Goyle had done. He was tiny in death. 

“You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,” 
said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin over his 
shoulder in a fireman’s lift and carried him into the 
Great Hall. 

Page | 786 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment 
and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He 
looked like an old man. Then he set off down the 
steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies. 

Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the 
Great Hall. People were moving around, trying to 
comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the 
dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, 
no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other 
Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the 
time remaining to him for just one last look at them; 
but then, would he ever have the strength to stop 
looking? It was better like this. 

He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. 

It was nearly four in the morning, and the deathly 
stillness of the grounds felt as though they were 
holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could 
do what he must. 

Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over 
another body. 

“Neville.” 

“Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!” 

Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to 
him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make 
absolutely sure. 

“Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked 
suspiciously. 

“It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry. “There’s 
something I’ve got to do. Listen — Neville — ” 



Page | 787 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry!” Neville looked suddenly scared. “Harry, 
you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?” 



“No,” Harry lied easily. “ ’Course not ... this is 
something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. 
You know Voldemort’s snake, Neville? He’s got a huge 
snake. ... Calls it Nagini ...” 

“I’ve heard, yeah. ... What about it?” 

“It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, 
but just in case they — ” 

The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a 
moment, made it impossible to keep talking. But he 
pulled himself together again: This was crucial, he 
must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make 
sure there were backups, others to carry on. 
Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still 
knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take 
Harry’s place: There would still be three in the secret. 

“Just in case they’re — busy — and you get the 
chance — ” 

“Kill the snake?” 

“Kill the snake,” Harry repeated. 

“All right, Harry. You’re okay, are you?” 

“I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.” 

But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move 
on. 

“We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know 
that?” 

Page | 788 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, I — ” 



The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the 
sentence; he could not go on. Neville did not seem to 
find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, 
released him, and walked away to look for more 
bodies. 

Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked 
on. Someone else was moving not far away, stooping 
over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet 
away from her when he realized it was Ginny. 

He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a 
girl who was whispering for her mother. 

“It’s all right,” Ginny was saying. “It’s okay. We’re 
going to get you inside.” 

“But I want to go home,” whispered the girl. “I don’t 
want to fight anymore!” 

“I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke. “It’s going 
to be all right.” 

Ripples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He 
wanted to shout out to the night, he wanted Ginny to 
know that he was there, he wanted her to know where 
he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged 
back, to be sent back home. ... 

But he was home. Hogwarts was the first and best 
home he had known. He and Voldemort and Snape, 
the abandoned boys, had all found home here. ... 

Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, 
holding her hand. With a huge effort Harry forced 
himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as 
he passed, and wondered whether she had sensed 

Page | 789 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and 
he did not look back. 

Hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were 
no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, 
his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to 
Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, 
and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great 
bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione 
helping him save Norbert ... 

He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the 
forest, and he stopped. 

A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; 
he could feel their chill, and he was not sure he would 
be able to pass safely through it. He had no strength 
left for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own 
trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every 
second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool 
air on his face, was so precious: To think that people 
had years and years, time to waste, so much time it 
dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the 
same time he thought that he would not be able to go 
on, and knew that he must. The long game was 
ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to 
leave the air. ... 

The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a 
moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it 
out. 

I open at the close. 

Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now 
that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible, it 
seemed to have sped up, and understanding was 
coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. 
This was the close. This was the moment. 

Page | 790 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He pressed the golden metal to his lips and 
whispered, “I am about to die.” 

The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking 
hand, raised Draco’s wand beneath the Cloak, and 
murmured, “Lumos.” 

The black stone with its jagged crack running down 
the center sat in the two halves of the Snitch. The 
Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line 
representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle 
representing the Cloak and the stone were still 
discernible. 

And again Harry understood without having to think. 
It did not matter about bringing them back, for he 
was about to join them. He was not really fetching 
them: They were fetching him. 

He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his 
hand three times. 

He knew it had happened, because he heard slight 
movements around him that suggested frail bodies 
shifting their footing on the earthy, twig- strewn 
ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. He 
opened his eyes and looked around. 

They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see 
that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had 
escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been 
memory made nearly solid. Less substantial than 
living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they 
moved toward him, and on each face, there was the 
same loving smile. 

James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was 
wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his 



Page | 791 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a 
little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s. 

Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far 
than Harry had seen him in life. He loped with an 
easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his 
face. 

Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and 
his hair was thicker and darker. He looked happy to 
be back in this familiar place, scene of so many 
adolescent wanderings. 

Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long 
hair back as she drew close to him, and her green 
eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as 
though she would never be able to look at him 
enough. 

“You’ve been so brave.” 

He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he 
thought that he would like to stand and look at her 
forever, and that would be enough. 

“You are nearly there,” said James. “Very close. We 
are ... so proud of you.” 

“Does it hurt?” 

The childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips 
before he could stop it. 

“Dying? Not at all,” said Sirius. “Quicker and easier 
than falling asleep.” 

“And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,” 
said Lupin. 



Page | 792 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I didn’t want you to die,” Harry said. These words 
came without his volition. “Any of you. I’m sorry — ” 



He addressed Lupin more than any of them, 
beseeching him. 

“ — right after you’d had your son ... Remus, I’m sorry 



“I am sorry too,” said Lupin. “Sorry I will never know 
him . . . but he will know why I died and I hope he will 
understand. I was trying to make a world in which he 
could live a happier life.” 

A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart 
of the forest lifted the hair at Harry’s brow. He knew 
that they would not tell him to go, that it would have 
to be his decision. 

“You’ll stay with me?” 

“Until the very end,” said James. 

“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry. 

“We are part of you,” said Sirius. “Invisible to anyone 
else.” 

Harry looked at his mother. 

“Stay close to me,” he said quietly. 

And he set off. The dementors’ chill did not overcome 
him; he passed through it with his companions, and 
they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they 
marched through the old trees that grew closely 
together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled 
and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak 
tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper 
Page | 793 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly 
Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. 
Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, 
Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his 
courage, and the reason he was able to keep putting 
one foot in front of the other. 

His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his 
limbs working without conscious instruction, as if he 
were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about 
to leave. The dead who walked beside him through 
the forest were much more real to him now than the 
living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and 
all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he 
stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, 
toward Voldemort. ... 

A thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had 
stirred close by. Harry stopped under the Cloak, 
peering around, listening, and his mother and father, 
Lupin and Sirius stopped too. 

“Someone there,” came a rough whisper close at 
hand. “He’s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be — ?” 

Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their 
wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov 
peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, 
his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. 
Apparently they could not see anything. 

“Definitely heard something,” said Yaxley. “Animal, 
d’you reckon?” 

“That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in 
here,” said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder. 

Yaxley looked down at his watch. 



Page | 794 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Time’s nearly up. Potter’s had his hour. He’s not 
coming.” 

“And he was sure he’d come! He won’t be happy.” 

“Better go back,” said Yaxley. “Find out what the plan 
is now.” 

He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the 
forest. Harry followed them, knowing that they would 
lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced 
sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his 
father nodded encouragement. 

They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw 
light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into 
a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where 
the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants 
of his vast web were there still, but the swarm of 
descendants he had spawned had been driven out by 
the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause. 

A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its 
flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, 
watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still 
masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two 
giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting 
massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, 
rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, 
chewing his long nails; the great blond Rowle was 
dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, 
who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, 
whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. 

Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with 
his head bowed, and his white hands folded over the 
Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been 
praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and 
Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought 
Page | 795 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and- 
seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the 
great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed 
cage, like a monstrous halo. 

When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, 
Voldemort looked up. 

“No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov. 

Voldemort ’s expression did not change. The red eyes 
seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he drew the 
Elder Wand between his long fingers. 

“My Lord — ” 

Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, 
disheveled, her face a little bloody but otherwise 
unharmed. 

Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did 
not speak another word, but eyed him in worshipful 
fascination. 

“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his 
high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. “I 
expected him to come.” 

Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, 
whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs 
as though determined to escape the body he was 
about to cast aside. His hands were sweating as he 
pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath 
his robes, with his wand. He did not want to be 
tempted to fight. 

“I was, it seems ... mistaken,” said Voldemort. 

“You weren’t.” 

Page | 796 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force 
he could muster: He did not want to sound afraid. 

The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his 
numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he 
saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he 
stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment he 
felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just 
the two of them. 

The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The 
giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and 
there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. 
Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red 
eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved 
toward him, with nothing but the fire between them. 

Then a voice yelled: “HARRY! NO!” 

He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a 
tree nearby. His massive body shook the branches 
overhead as he struggled, desperate. 

“NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE YEH — ?” 

“QUIET!” shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand 
Hagrid was silenced. 

Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking 
eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast heaving. 
The only things that moved were the flames and the 
snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage 
behind Voldemort’s head. 

Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he 
made no attempt to draw it. He knew that the snake 
was too well protected, knew that if he managed to 
point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him 
first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each 
other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to 
Page | 797 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the side, considering the boy standing before him, 
and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless 
mouth. 

“Harry Potter,” he said very softly. His voice might 
have been part of the spitting fire. “The Boy Who 
Lived.” 

None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: 
Everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and 
Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably 
of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips 
on his — 

Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still 
tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what 
would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into 
the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, 
while he could still stand, before he lost control, 
before he betrayed fear — 

He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, 
and everything was gone.

KING’S CROSS 

He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was 
perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else 
was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was 
there himself. 

A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to 
him that he must exist, must be more than 
disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely 
lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of 
touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. 

Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, 
Harry became conscious that he was naked. 
Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not 
concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He 
wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able 
to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had 
eyes. 

He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he 
had ever experienced before. His surroundings were 
not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor 

Page | 799 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on 
which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor 
cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on 
which to be. 

He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched 
his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore. 

Then a noise reached him through the unformed 
nothingness that surrounded him: the small soft 
thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and 
struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly 
indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he 
was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. 

For the first time, he wished he were clothed. 

Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes 
appeared a short distance away. He took them and 
pulled them on: They were soft, clean, and warm. It 
was extraordinary how they had appeared, just like 
that, the moment he had wanted them. ... 

He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great 
Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more 
there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered 
high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. 
All was hushed and still, except for those odd 
thumping and whimpering noises coming from 
somewhere close by in the mist. ... 

Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his 
surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his 
eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall 
larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear, 
domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the 
only person there, except for — 



Page | 800 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was 
making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked 
child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, 
flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat 
where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, 
struggling for breath. 

He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded 
though it was, he did not want to approach it. 
Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump 
back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to 
touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He 
felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it 
repulsed him. 

“You cannot help.” 

He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking 
toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping 
robes of midnight blue. 

“Harry.” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were 
both whole and white and undamaged. “You 
wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.” 

Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away 
from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading 
him to two seats that Harry had not previously 
noticed, set some distance away under that high, 
sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of 
them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old 
headmaster’s face. Dumbledore ’s long silver hair and 
beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon 
spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he 
had remembered it. And yet... 

“But you’re dead,” said Harry. 

“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. 

Page | 801 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Then ... I’m dead too?” 



“Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. 
“That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, 
I think not.” 

They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. 
“Not?” repeated Harry. 

“Not,” said Dumbledore. 

“But ...” Harry raised his hand instinctively toward 
the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. “But I 
should have died — I didn’t defend myself! I meant to 
let him kill me!” 

“And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have 
made all the difference.” 

Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like 
light, like fire: Harry had never seen the man so 
utterly, so palpably content. 

“Explain,” said Harry. 

“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He 
twiddled his thumbs together. 

“I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?” 

“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!” 

“So the part of his soul that was in me ...” 

Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, 
urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement 
on his face. 



Page | 802 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




"... has it gone?” 



“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. 

Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.” 

“But then ...” 

Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, 
maimed creature trembled under the chair. 

“What is that, Professor?” 

“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said 
Dumbledore. 

“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry 
started again, “and nobody died for me this time — 
how can I be alive?” 

“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. 
Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed 
and his cruelty.” 

Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his 
surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they 
sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows 
and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and 
Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair 
were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to 
his lips easily, without effort. 

“He took my blood,” said Harry. 

“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and 
rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, 
Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He tethered 
you to life while he lives!” 



Page | 803 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I live . . . while he lives? But I thought ... I thought it 
was the other way round! I thought we both had to 
die? Or is it the same thing?” 

He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping 
of the agonized creature behind them and glanced 
back at it yet again. 

“Are you sure we can’t do anything?” 

“There is no help possible.” 

“Then explain ... more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore 
smiled. 

“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux 
he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so 
unstable that it broke apart when he committed those 
acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, 
the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped 
from that room was even less than he knew. He left 
more than his body behind. He left part of himself 
latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. 

“And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, 
Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes 
no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and 
children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, 
Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. 
That they all have a power beyond his own, a power 
beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has 
never grasped. 

“He took your blood believing it would strengthen 
him. He took into his body a tiny part of the 
enchantment your mother laid upon you when she 
died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and 
while that enchantment survives, so do you and so 
does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.” 

Page | 804 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at 
him. 



“And you knew this? You knew — all along?” 

“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” 
said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for 
what seemed like a long time, while the creature 
behind them continued to whimper and tremble. 

“There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why 
did my wand break the wand he borrowed?” 

“As to that, I cannot be sure.” 

“Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore 
laughed. 

“What you must understand, Harry, is that you and 
Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms 
of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is 
what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and 
no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it 
or explained it to Voldemort. 

“Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord 
Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he 
returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still 
attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen 
himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into 
himself. If he could only have understood the precise 
and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, 
perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. ... But then, 
if he had been able to understand, he could not be 
Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at 
all. 

“Having ensured this two-fold connection, having 
wrapped your destinies together more securely than 

Page | 805 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort 
proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a 
core with yours. And now something very strange 
happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way 
that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand 
was twin of his, had never expected. 

“He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. 
You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of 
death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able 
to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. 
And in doing so, something happened between those 
wands, something that echoed the relationship 
between their masters. 

“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power 
and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is 
to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. 
So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, 
recognized a man who was both kin and mortal 
enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic 
against him, magic much more powerful than 
anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your 
wand now contained the power of your enormous 
courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What 
chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?” 

“But if my wand was so powerful, how come 
Hermione was able to break it?” asked Harry. 

“My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed 
only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly 
with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was 
that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a 
wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,” 
Dumbledore finished kindly. 



Page | 806 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps 
seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like 
time, here. 

“He killed me with your wand.” 

“He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore 
corrected Harry. “I think we can agree that you are 
not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if fearing 
he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your 
sufferings, which I am sure were severe.” 

“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, 
looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. 
“Where are we, exactly?” 

“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, 
looking around. “Where would you say that we are?” 

Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. 
Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready 
to give. 

“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station. 
Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no 
trains as far as I can see.” 

“King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling 
immoderately. “Good gracious, really?” 

“Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a 
little defensively. 

“My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, 
your party.” 

Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was 
being infuriating. He glared at him, then remembered 



Page | 807 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




a much more pressing question than that of their 
current location. 

“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to 
see that the words wiped the smile from 
Dumbledore’s face. 

“Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried. 
“Well?” 

For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, 
he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked 
fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. 

“Can you forgive me?” he said. “Can you forgive me 
for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only 
feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only 
dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave 
your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, 
that you are the better man.” 

“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled 
by Dumbledore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his 
eyes. 

“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. 
“A desperate man’s dream!” 

“But they’re real!” 

“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said 
Dumbledore. “And I was such a fool. But you know, 
don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You 
know.” 

“What do I know?” 



Page | 808 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and 
tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. 



“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I 
better, ultimately, than Voldemort?” 

“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course — how 
can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid 
it!” 



“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a 
child seeking reassurance. “Yet I too sought a way to 
conquer death, Harry.” 

“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at 
Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the 
high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from 
himself. “Hallows, not Horcruxes.” 

“Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes. 
Precisely.” 

There was a pause. The creature behind them 
whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. 

“Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked. 

Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and 
nodded. 

“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he 
said quietly. “Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared 
obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I 
am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of 
Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the 
third brother had died.” 

“So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell 
brothers — ” 

Page | 809 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ — were the three brothers of the tale,” said 
Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether 
they met Death on a lonely road ... I think it more 
likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, 
dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those 
powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own 
Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might 
have sprung up around such creations. 

“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through 
the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right 
down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was 
born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s 
Hollow.” 

Dumbledore smiled at Harry. 

“Me?” 

“You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was 
in my possession on the night your parents died. 
James had showed it to me just a few days 
previously. It explained much of his undetected 
wrong-doing at school! I could hardly believe what I 
was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had 
long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, 
but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer 
look. ... It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never 
seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and 
then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, 
all to myself!” 

His tone was unbearably bitter. 

“The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, 
though,” Harry said quickly. “Voldemort knew where 
my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have 
made them curse-proof.” 



Page | 810 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.” 



Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he 
prompted him. 

“So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you 
saw the Cloak?” 

“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he 
forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. “You know what 
happened. You know. You cannot despise me more 
than I despise myself.” 

“But I don’t despise you — ” 

“Then you should,” said Dumbledore. He drew a deep 
breath. “You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, 
what those Muggles did, what she became. You know 
how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the 
price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother 
gave up her own life to care for Ariana. 

“I resented it, Harry.” 

Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking 
now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance. 

“I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I 
wanted to shine. I wanted glory. 

“Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain 
crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. “I 
loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother 
and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish 
than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could 
possibly imagine. 

“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the 
responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward 

Page | 811 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




brother, I returned to my village in anger and 
bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, 
of course, he came. ...” 

Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again. 

“Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas 
caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into 
subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald 
and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. 

“Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience 
with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, 
and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in 
benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of 
hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, 
but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making 
came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. 

“And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly 
Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they 
fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the 
weapon that would lead us to power! The 
Resurrection Stone — to him, though I pretended not 
to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I 
confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the 
lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. 

“And the Cloak ... somehow, we never discussed the 
Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal 
ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true 
magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to 
protect and shield others as well as its owner. I 
thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in 
hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was 
mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said 
that the man who united all three objects would then 
be truly master of death, which we took to mean 
‘invincible.’ 

Page | 812 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and 
Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel 
dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my 
family left to me. 

“And then ... you know what happened. Reality 
returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and 
infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to 
hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to 
hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a 
fragile and unstable sister in tow. 

“The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost 
control. That which I had always sensed in him, 
though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible 
being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and 
caution ... lay dead upon the floor.” 

Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in 
earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that 
he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and 
Dumbledore gradually regained control. 

“Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have 
predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing 
power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his 
dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I 
had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I 
was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my 
guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. 

“Years passed. There were rumors about him. They 
said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, 
meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, 
not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had 
learned that I was not to be trusted with power.” 

“But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge 
or Scrimgeour!” burst out Harry. 

Page | 813 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so 
sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power 
was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious 
thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited 
to power are those who have never sought it. Those 
who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and 
take up the mantle because they must, and find to 
their own surprise that they wear it well. 

“I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher 



“You were the best — ” 

“ — you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied 
myself with the training of young wizards, 

Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared 
me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I 
feared him. 

“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to 
Harry’s questioning look. “Not what he could do to me 
magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, 
perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the 
truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in 
that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse 
that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You 
would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the 
knowledge that it had been I who brought about her 
death, not merely through my arrogance and 
stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that 
snuffed out her life. 

“I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened 
me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have 
been too shameful to resist any longer. People were 
dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do 
what I could.

“Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. 

I won the wand.” 

Another silence. Harry did not ask whether 
Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana 
dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he 
want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew 
what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in 
the Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been 
so understanding of the fascination it had exercised 
over Harry. 

They sat in silence for a long time, and the 
whimperings of the creature behind them barely 
disturbed Harry anymore. 

At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort 
going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he 
had never had it.” 

Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears 
still glittering on the crooked nose. 

“They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in 
his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would 
like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what 
he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his 
attempt to make amends ... to prevent Voldemort 
from taking the Hallow ...” 

"... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” 
suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes. 

After another short pause Harry said, “You tried to 
use the Resurrection Stone.” 

Dumbledore nodded. 



Page | 815 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in 
the abandoned home of the Gaunts — the Hallow I 
had craved most of all, though in my youth I had 
wanted it for very different reasons — I lost my head, 
Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that 
the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and 
I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was 
about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, 
and to tell them how very, very sorry I was. ... 

“I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had 
learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly 
Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was 
final proof.” 

“Why?” said Harry. “It was natural! You wanted to see 
them again. What’s wrong with that?” 

“Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, 
Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, 
the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder 
Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I 
was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, 
not for gain, but to save others from it. 

“But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it 
could never have worked for me as it works for you, 
its true owner. The stone I would have used in an 
attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather 
than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are 
the worthy possessor of the Hallows.” 

Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked 
up at the old man and smiled; he could not help 
himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore 
now? 

“Why did you have to make it so difficult?” 



Page | 816 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous. 



“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you 
up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might 
dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if 
presented outright with the facts about those 
tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I 
did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you 
laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them 
safely. You are the true master of death, because the 
true master does not seek to run away from Death. 

He accepts that he must die, and understands that 
there are far, far worse things in the living world than 
dying.” 

“And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?” 

“I do not think so, because he did not recognize the 
Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But 
even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that 
he would have been interested in any except the first. 
He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as 
for the stone, whom would he want to bring back 
from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.” 

“But you expected him to go after the wand?” 

“I have been sure that he would try, ever since your 
wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little 
Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had 
conquered him by superior skill. Once he had 
kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the 
existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained 
everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better 
against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking 
himself what quality it was in you that had made your 
wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did 
not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they 
said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand 
Page | 817 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




has become an obsession to rival his obsession with 
you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last 
weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor 
Severus ...” 

“If you planned your death with Snape, you meant 
him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” 

“I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, 
“but it did not work as I intended, did it?” 

“No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.” 

The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and 
Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the 
longest time yet. The realization of what would 
happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long 
minutes, like softly falling snow. 

“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?” 

“That is up to you.” 

“I’ve got a choice?” 

“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in 
King’s Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not 
to go back, you would be able to ... let’s say ... board 
a train.” 

“And where would it take me?” 

“On,” said Dumbledore simply. 

Silence again. 

“Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.” 

“True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.” 

Page | 818 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But you want me to go back?” 

“I think,” said Dumbledore, “that if you choose to 
return, there is a chance that he may be finished for 
good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that 
you have less to fear from returning here than he 
does.” 

Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that 
trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the 
distant chair. 

“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, 
above all, those who live without love. By returning, 
you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer 
families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy 
goal, then we say good-bye for the present.” 

Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would 
not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had 
been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, 
and he knew that he was heading back to pain and 
the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore 
did the same, and they looked for a long moment into 
each other’s faces. 

“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or 
has this been happening inside my head?” 

Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded 
loud and strong in Harry’s ears even though the 
bright mist was descending again, obscuring his 
figure. 

“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, 
but why on earth should that mean that it is not 
real?” * 



Page | 819 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 






THE FLAW IN THE PLAN 

He was lying facedown on the ground again. The 
smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the 
cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of 
his glasses, which had been knocked sideways by the 
fall, cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, 
and the place where the Killing Curse had hit him felt 
like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, 
but remained exactly where he had fallen, with his 
left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth 
gaping. 

He had expected to hear cheers of triumph and 
jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, 
whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air. 

“My Lord ...my Lord ...” 

It was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. 
Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his 
other senses to explore his predicament. He knew 
that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes 
because he could feel it pressed between his chest 

Page | 820 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area 
of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was 
also there, stuffed out of sight. 

“My Lord ...” 

“That will do,” said Voldemort’s voice. 

More footsteps: Several people were backing away 
from the same spot. Desperate to see what was 
happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a 
millimeter. 

Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various 
Death Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning 
to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone 
remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort. 

Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he 
had seen. The Death Eaters had been huddled 
around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the 
ground. Something had happened when he had hit 
Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too 
collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had 
fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now 
returned. ... 

“My Lord, let me — ” 

“I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, 
and though he could not see it, Harry pictured 
Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. “The boy ... Is 
he dead?” 

There was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody 
approached Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze; 
it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he 
was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch. 



Page | 821 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You,” said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a 
small shriek of pain. “Examine him. Tell me whether 
he is dead.” 

Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He 
could only lie there, with his heart thumping 
traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the 
same time noting, small comfort though it was, that 
Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that 
Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan. ... 

Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched 
Harry’s face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his 
shirt, down to his chest, and felt his heart. He could 
hear the woman’s fast breathing, her long hair tickled 
his face. He knew that she could feel the steady 
pounding of life against his ribs. 

“Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?” 

The whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch 
from his ear, her head bent so low that her long hair 
shielded his face from the onlookers. 

“Yes,” he breathed back. 

He felt the hand on his chest contract; her nails 
pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up. 

“He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. 

And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph 
and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, 

Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the 
air in celebration. 

Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. 
Narcissa knew that the only way she would be 
permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as 

Page | 822 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




part of the conquering army. She no longer cared 
whether Voldemort won. 

“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. 
“Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive 
can threaten me now! Watch! CrucioV’ 

Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not 
be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; 
it must be subjected to humiliation to prove 
Voldemort’s victory. He was lifted into the air, and it 
took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain 
he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, 
three times into the air: His glasses flew off and he 
felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he 
kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell to 
the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with 
jeers and shrieks of laughter. 

“Now,” said Voldemort, “we go to the castle, and show 
them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag 
the body? No — Wait — ” 

There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a 
few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath 
him. 

“You carry him,” Voldemort said. “He will be nice and 
visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little 
friend, Hagrid. And the glasses — put on the glasses 
— he must be recognizable — ” 

Someone slammed Harry’s glasses back onto his face 
with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that 
lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry 
could feel Hagrid ’s arms trembling with the force of 
his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon 
him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry 



Page | 823 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to 
Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. 

“Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled 
forward, forcing his way through the close-growing 
trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at 
Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his 
mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the 
darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around 
them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody 
looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed 
neck of Harry Potter. . . . 

The two giants crashed along behind the Death 
Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as 
they passed; they made so much din that birds rose 
shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death 
Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession 
marched on toward the open ground, and after a 
while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the 
darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees 
were beginning to thin. 

“BANE!” 

Hagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry’s eyes 
open. “Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn’ fight, yeh 
cowardly bunch o’ nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s 
— d-dead...?” 

Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh 
tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were 
watching their procession pass; he dared not open his 
eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults 
at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, 
Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they 
had reached the edge of the forest. 

“Stop.” 

Page | 824 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to 
obey Voldemort’s command, because he lurched a 
little. And now a chill settled over them where they 
stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the 
dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would 
not affect him now. The fact of his own survival 
burned inside him, a talisman against them, as 
though his father’s stag kept guardian in his heart. 

Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it 
was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment 
later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled 
through the grounds, crashing upon Harry’s 
eardrums. 

“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, 
trying to save himself while you lay down your lives 
for him. We bring you his body as proof that your 
hero is gone. 

“The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. 
My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who 
Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone 
who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be 
slaughtered, as will every member of their family. 
Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you 
shall be spared. Your parents and children, your 
brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you 
will join me in the new world we shall build together.” 

There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. 
Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare 
open his eyes again. 

“Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move 
ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry 
opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort 
striding in front of them, wearing the great snake 
Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her 
Page | 825 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of 
extracting the wand concealed under his robes 
without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who 
marched on either side of them through the slowly 
lightening darkness. ... 

“Harry,” sobbed Hagrid. “Oh, Harry ... Harry ...” 

Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they 
were approaching the castle and strained his ears to 
distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death 
Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from 
those within. 

“Stop.” 

The Death Eaters came to a halt: Harry heard them 
spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of 
the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, 
the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him 
from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the 
people for whom he had tried to die would see him, 
lying apparently dead, in Hagrid ’s arms. 

“NO!” 

The scream was the more terrible because he had 
never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall 
could make such a sound. He heard another woman 
laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in 
McGonagall’s despair. He squinted again for a single 
second and saw the open doorway filling with people, 
as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front 
steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of 
Harry’s death for themselves. He saw Voldemort 
standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini’s 
head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes 
again. 



Page | 826 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No!” 



“iVo!” 

“Harry! HARRY!” 

Ron’s, Hermione’s, and Ginny’s voices were worse 
than McGonagall’s; Harry wanted nothing more than 
to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their 
cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took 
up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the 
Death Eaters, until — 

“SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang 
and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced 
upon them all. “It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at 
my feet, where he belongs!” 

Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. 

“You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding 
backward and forward right beside the place where he 
lay. “Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, 
deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who 
relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!” 

“He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and 
the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and 
screaming again until a second, more powerful bang 
extinguished their voices once more. 

“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle 
grounds,” said Voldemort, and there was relish in his 
voice for the lie, “killed while trying to save himself — ” 

But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a 
shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt 
of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. 
Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at 

Page | 827 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground, 
Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger’s wand 
aside and laughing. 

“And who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. 
“Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens 
to those who continue to fight when the battle is 
lost?” 

Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. 

“It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has 
been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of 
the Aurors, remember?” 

“Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down 
at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, 
unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man ’s- 
land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. 

“But you are a pureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” 
Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his 
empty hands curled in fists. 

“So what if I am?” said Neville loudly. 

“You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble 
stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We 
need your kind, Neville Longbottom.” 

“I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. 
“Dumbledore’s Army!” he shouted, and there was an 
answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort’s 
Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. 

“Very well,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard more 
danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most 
powerful curse. “If that is your choice, Longbottom, 
we revert to the original plan. On your head,” he said 
quietly, “be it.” 

Page | 828 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw 
Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of 
the castle’s shattered windows, something that looked 
like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and 
landed in Voldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed 
object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and 
ragged: the Sorting Hat. 

“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” 
said Voldemort. “There will be no more Houses. The 
emblem, shield, and colors of my noble ancestor, 
Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone. Won’t 
they, Neville Longbottom?” 

He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and 
still, then forced the hat onto Neville’s head, so that it 
slipped down below his eyes. There were movements 
from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as 
one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the 
fighters of Hogwarts at bay. 

“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what 
happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to 
oppose me,” said Voldemort, and with a flick of his 
wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames. 

Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, 
rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could 
not bear it: He must act — 

And then many things happened at the same 
moment. 

They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the 
school as what sounded like hundreds of people came 
swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted 
toward the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the 
same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of 
the castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His cry was 
Page | 829 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




answered by roars from Voldemort’s giants: They ran 
at Grawp like bull elephants, making the earth quake. 
Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and 
arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death 
Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. 
Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his 
robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, 
as Neville moved too. 

In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the 
Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat fell off 
him and he drew from its depths something silver, 
with a glittering, rubied handle — 

The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over 
the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the 
clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and 
yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single stroke 
Neville sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun 
high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from 
the entrance hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open 
in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the 
snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet — 

Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a 
Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before 
the latter could raise his wand. Then, over the 
screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of 
the battling giants, Hagrid’s yell came loudest of all. 

“HARRY!” Hagrid shouted. “HARRY — WHERE’S 
HARRY?” 

Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering 
the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants’ 
stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the 
reinforcements that had come from who knew where; 
Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the 
heads of Voldemort’s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak 
Page | 830 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp 
punched and pummeled them; and now the wizards, 
defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were 
being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting 
jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, 
and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit 
them, and their bodies were trampled by the 
retreating crowd. 

Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was 
buffeted into the entrance hall: He was searching for 
Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells 
from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still 
screaming instructions to his followers as he sent 
curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield 
Charms, and Voldemort’s would-be victims, Seamus 
Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into 
the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already 
flourishing inside it. 

And now there were more, even more people storming 
up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley 
overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing 
his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned 
at the head of what looked like the families and 
friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained 
to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners 
of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan, and 
Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of 
hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the 
kitchens was blasted off its hinges. 

The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the 
entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives 
and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus 
Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his 
bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din: “Fight! 
Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! 



Page | 831 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! 
Fight!” 

They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and 
shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with 
malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters 
were folding under sheer weight of numbers, 
overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, 
stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting 
to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. 

But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, 
past struggling prisoners, and into the Great Hall. 

Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was 
striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not 
get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still 
invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more 
crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way 
inside. 

Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and 
Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at 
Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across 
the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and 
slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and 
Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth 
Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring 
Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running 
through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, 
screaming for their son. 

Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, 
and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in 
his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable 
to finish him — 

Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from 
Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at 

Page | 832 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all battling their 
hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry’s 
attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close 
to Ginny that she missed death by an inch — 

He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than 
Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was 
knocked sideways. 

“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!” 

Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing 
her arms. Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with 
laughter at the sight of her new challenger. 

“OUT OF MY WAY!” shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three 
girls, and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. 
Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly 
Weasley’s wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix 
Lestrange’s smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of 
light flew from both wands, the floor around the 
witches’ feet became hot and cracked; both women 
were fighting to kill. 

“No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran 
forward, trying to come to her aid. “Get back! Get 
back ! She is mine!” 

Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the 
two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, 
Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn 
between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, 
unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. 

“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed 
you?” taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, 
capering as Molly’s curses danced around her. “When 
Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?” 



Page | 833 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“You — will — never — touch — our — children — 
again!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. 

Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her 
cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward 
through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was 
going to happen before it did. 

Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched 
arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over 
her heart. 

Bellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to 
bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what 
had happened, and then she toppled, and the 
watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed. 

Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw 
McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted 
backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as 
Voldemort ’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant 
exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised 
his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. 

“Protego\” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm 
expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort 
stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the 
Invisibility Cloak at last. 

The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every 
side of “Harry!” “HE’S ALIVE!” were stifled at once. 

The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and 
completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each 
other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each 
other. 

“I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” Harry said 
loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a 
trumpet call. “It’s got to be like this. It’s got to be me.” 

Page | 834 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Voldemort hissed. 



“Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. 
“That isn’t how he works, is it? Who are you going to 
use as a shield today, Potter?” 

“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more 
Horcruxes. It’s just you and me. Neither can live while 
the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for 
good. ...” 

“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body 
was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was 
about to strike. “You think it will be you, do you, the 
boy who has survived by accident, and because 
Dumbledore was pulling the strings?” 

“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” 
asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of 
them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same 
distance from each other, and for Harry no face 
existed but Voldemort’s. “Accident, when I decided to 
fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend 
myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to 
fight again?” 

“Accidents'.” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not 
strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if 
Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody 
seemed to breathe but they two. “Accident and 
chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled 
behind the skirts of greater men and women, and 
permitted me to kill them for you!” 

“You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry 
as they circled, and stared into each other’s eyes, 
green into red. “You won’t be able to kill any of them 
ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop 
you from hurting these people — ” 

Page | 835 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“But you did not!” 



“ — I meant to, and that’s what did it. I’ve done what 
my mother did. They’re protected from you. Haven’t 
you noticed how none of the spells you put on them 
are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch 
them. You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do 
you?” 

“ You dare — ” 

“Yes, I dare,” said Harry. “I know things you don’t 
know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things 
that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you make 
another big mistake?” 

Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and 
Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized 
and at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that 
Harry might indeed know a final secret. ... 

“Is it love again?” said Voldemort, his snake’s face 
jeering. “Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which 
he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop 
him falling from the tower and breaking like an old 
waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping 
out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter — 
and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward 
this time and take my curse. So what will stop you 
dying now when I strike?” 

“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled 
each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by 
nothing but the last secret. 

“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said 
Voldemort, “you must believe that you have magic 
that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than 
mine?” 

Page | 836 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock flit 
across the snakelike face, though it was instantly 
dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound 
was more frightening than his screams; humorless 
and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. 

“You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. 
“Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed 
magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?” 

“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more 
than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.” 

“You mean he was weak!” screamed Voldemort. “Too 
weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been 
his, what will be mine!” 

“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better 
wizard, a better man.” 

“I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!” 

“You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were 
wrong.” 

For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the 
hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as 
one. 

“Dumbledore is dead\” Voldemort hurled the words at 
Harry as though they would cause him unendurable 
pain. “His body decays in the marble tomb in the 
grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he 
will not return!” 

“Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but 
you didn’t have him killed. He chose his own manner 
of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the 



Page | 837 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




whole thing with the man you thought was your 
servant.” 

“What childish dream is this?” said Voldemort, but 
still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver 
from Harry’s. 

“Severus Snape wasn’t yours,” said Harry. “Snape 
was Dumbledore’s, Dumbledore’s from the moment 
you started hunting down my mother. And you never 
realized it, because of the thing you can’t understand. 
You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, 
Riddle?” 

Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle 
each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. 

“Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” said Harry, “the same 
as my mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of 
his life, from the time when they were children. You 
should have realized,” he said as he saw Voldemort’s 
nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t 
he?” 

“He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, 

“but when she had gone, he agreed that there were 
other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him — ” 

“Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was 
Dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened 
her, and he’s been working against you ever since! 
Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished 
him!” 

“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had 
followed every word with rapt attention, but now let 
out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not whether 
Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty 
obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them 
Page | 838 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




as I crushed your mother, Snape ’s supposed great 
love\ Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways 
that you do not understand! 

“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from 
me! He intended that Snape should be the true 
master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little 
boy — I reached the wand before you could get your 
hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught 
up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the 
Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is 
truly mine! Dumbledore ’s last plan went wrong, Harry 
Potter!” 

“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before 
you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what 
you’ve done. ... Think, and try for some remorse, 
Riddle. ...” 

“What is this?” 

Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond 
any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked 
Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to 
thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. 

“It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve 
got left. ... I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. ... Be a 
man ... try ... Try for some remorse. ...” 

“You dare — ?” said Voldemort again. 

“Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore’s last 
plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on 
you, Riddle.” 

Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, 
and Harry gripped Draco’s very tightly. The moment, 
he knew, was seconds away. 

Page | 839 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“That wand still isn’t working properly for you 
because you murdered the wrong person. Severus 
Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. 
He never defeated Dumbledore.” 

“He killed — ” 

“Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledorel 
Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! 
Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand’s 
last true master! If all had gone as planned, the 
wand’s power would have died with him, because it 
had never been won from him!” 

“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the 
wand!” Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious 
pleasure. “I stole the wand from its last master’s 
tomb! I removed it against its last master’s wishes! Its 
power is mine!” 

“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the 
wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make 
it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The 
wand chooses the wizard. ... The Elder Wand 
recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, 
someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new 
master removed the wand from Dumbledore against 
his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or 
that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him 
its allegiance. ...” 

Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry 
could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the 
wand pointed at his face. 

“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco 
Malfoy.” 



Page | 840 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a 
moment, but then it was gone. 

“But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you 
are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and 
me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel 
on skill alone ... and after I have killed you, I can 
attend to Draco Malfoy. ...” 

“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your 
chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks 
ago. I took this wand from him.” 

Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the 
eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. 

“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered 
Harry. “Does the wand in your hand know its last 
master was Disarmed? Because if it does ... I am the 
true master of the Elder Wand.” 

A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted 
sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared 
over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both 
of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s 
was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high 
voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the 
heavens, pointing Draco’s wand: 

“Avada KedavraV’ 

“ Expelliarmus\ ” 

The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden 
flames that erupted between them, at the dead center 
of the circle they had been treading, marked the point 
where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s 
green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly 
high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the 
Page | 841 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning 
through the air toward the master it would not kill, 
who had come to take full possession of it at last. And 
Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught 
the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, 
arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling 
upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane 
finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white 
hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and 
unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own 
rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in 
his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell. 

One shivering second of silence, the shock of the 
moment suspended: and then the tumult broke 
around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the 
roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun 
dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, 
and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, 
and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, 
their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. 
Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then 
all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and 
McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could 
not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell 
whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to 
hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, 
all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, 
the reason it was over at last — 

The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great 
Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an 
indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of 
jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. 

They wanted him there with them, their leader and 
symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had 
not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of 
them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to 
the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, 
Page | 842 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in 
from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the 
Imperiused up and down the country had come back 
to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else 
being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were 
being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley 
Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of 
Magic. ... 

They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a 
chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, 
Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had 
died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the 
House tables, but nobody was sitting according to 
House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers 
and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house- 
elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and 
Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and 
people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. 
After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found 
himself sitting on a bench beside Luna. 

“I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,” she 
said. 

“I’d love some,” he replied. 

“I’ll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.” 

And before he could say a word she had cried, “Oooh, 
look, a Blibbering Humdinger!” and pointed out of the 
window. Everyone who heard looked around, and 
Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his 
feet. 

Now he could move through the Hall without 
interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she 
was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder: 
There would be time to talk later, hours and days and 

Page | 843 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the 
sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, 
surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the 
aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted 
the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure 
whether or not they were supposed to be there, but 
nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere 
he looked he saw families reunited, and finally, he 
saw the two whose company he craved most. 

“It’s me,” he muttered, crouching down between 
them. “Will you come with me?” 

They stood up at once, and together he, Ron, and 
Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks were 
missing from the marble staircase, part of the 
balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains 
occurred every few steps as they climbed. 

Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves 
zooming through the corridors singing a victory song 
of his own composition: 

We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, 

And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun! 

“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the 
thing, doesn’t it?” said Ron, pushing open a door to 
let Harry and Hermione through. 

Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the 
moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of 
losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a 
physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the 
most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But 
first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, 
who had stuck with him for so long, and who 
deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what 
Page | 844 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened 
in the forest, and they had not even begun to express 
all their shock and amazement when at last they 
arrived at the place to which they had been walking, 
though none of them had mentioned their 
destination. 

Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the 
entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked 
aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, 
and Harry wondered whether it would be able to 
distinguish passwords anymore. 

“Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle. 

“Feel free,” groaned the statue. 

They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone 
staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. 
Harry pushed open the door at the top. 

He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the 
desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting 
noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and 
returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort 



But it was applause. All around the walls, the 
headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were 
giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats 
and in some cases their wigs, they reached through 
their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced 
up and down on the chairs in which they had been 
painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter 
Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas 
Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be 
noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our 
contribution not be forgotten!” 



Page | 845 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the 
largest portrait directly behind the headmaster’s 
chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half- 
moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the 
pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled 
Harry with the same balm as phoenix song. 

At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell 
respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes 
and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his 
words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with 
enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he 
was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last 
piece of advice. 

“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, 

“I dropped it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, 
but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you 
agree?” 

“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow 
pictures looked confused and curious. “A wise and 
courageous decision, but no less than I would have 
expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?” 

“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his 
satisfaction. 

“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said 
Harry, and Dumbledore beamed. 

“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you 
pass it on!” 

“And then there’s this.” 

Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and 
Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in 



Page | 846 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not 
like to see. 

“I don’t want it,” said Harry. 

“What?” said Ron loudly. “Are you mental?” 

“I know it’s powerful,” said Harry wearily. “But I was 
happier with mine. So ...” 

He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, 
and pulled out the two halves of holly still just 
connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather. 
Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, 
that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that 
if this did not work, nothing would. 

He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, 
touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and 
said, “Reparo.” 

As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. 
Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the 
holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in 
his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing 
at their reunion. 

“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, 
who was watching him with enormous affection and 
admiration, “back where it came from. It can stay 
there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power 
will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will 
never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.” 

Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. 

“Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace 
of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand. 



Page | 847 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly. 

“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said 
Harry. “And quite honestly,” he turned away from the 
painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster 
bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and 
wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a 
sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a 
lifetime.”

ayue 




NINETEEN YEARS LATER 

Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The 
morning of the first of September was crisp and 
golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed 
across the rumbling road toward the great sooty 
station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of 
pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two 
large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the 
parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted 
indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully 
behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm. 

“It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told 
her. 

“Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I want to go now\” 

The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the 
family wove its way toward the barrier between 
platforms nine and ten. Albus’s voice drifted back to 
Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had 
resumed the argument they had started in the car. 



Page | 849 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 



“I won’ti I won’t be in Slytherin!” 

“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny. 

“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his 
younger brother. “There’s nothing wrong with that. He 
might be in Slyth — ” 

But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. 

The five Potters approached the barrier. With a 
slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger 
brother, James took the trolley from his mother and 
broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. 

“You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his 
parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary 
absence of his brother. 

“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny. 

“Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most 
people only get letters from home about once a 
month.” 

“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” 
said Ginny. 

“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you 
about Hogwarts,” Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, 
your brother.” 

Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, 
gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus 
winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family 
emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, 
which was obscured by thick white steam that was 
pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct 
figures were swarming through the mist, into which 
James had already disappeared. 

Page | 850 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at 
the hazy forms they passed as they made their way 
down the platform. 

“Well find them,” said Ginny reassuringly. 

But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make 
out anybody’s faces. Detached from their owners, 
voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he 
heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick 
regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to 
stop and say hello. ... 

“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly. 

A group of four people emerged from the mist, 
standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces 
only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and 
Albus had drawn right up to them. 

“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. 

Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new 
Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. 

“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. 
Hermione didn’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving 
test, did you? She thought I’d have to Confund the 
examiner.” 

“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in 
you.” 

“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron 
whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus ’s 
trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to look in 
the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use a 
Supersensory Charm for that.” 



Page | 851 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, 
Rose’s younger brother, having an animated 
discussion about which House they would be sorted 
into when they finally went to Hogwarts. 

“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said 
Ron, “but no pressure.” 

“Ron\” 

Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked 
solemn. 

“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but 
Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry’s 
eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards 
away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and 
three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting 
mist. 

“Look who it is.” 

Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and 
son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair 
was receding somewhat, which emphasized the 
pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much 
as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of 
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, 
nodded curtly, and turned away again. 

“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. 
“Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank 
God you inherited your mother’s brains.” 

“Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, 
half amused. “Don’t try to turn them against each 
other before they’ve even started school!”

“You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help 
himself, he added, “Don’t get too friendly with him, 
though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive 
you if you married a pureblood.” 

“Hey!” 

James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his 
trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting 
with news. 

“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing 
back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of 
steam. “Just seen him! And guess what he’s doing? 
Snogging Victoire\” 

He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by 
the lack of reaction. 

“Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin\ Snogging our Victoire! Our 
cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was doing — ” 

“You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like 
Ron — ” 

“ — and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he 
told me to go away. He’s snogging her!” James added 
as though worried he had not made himself clear. 

“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered 
Lily ecstatically. “Teddy would really be part of the 
family then!” 

“He already comes round for dinner about four times 
a week,” said Harry. “Why don’t we just invite him to 
live with us and have done with it?” 

“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind 
sharing with A1 — Teddy could have my room!”

“No,” said Harry firmly, “you and A1 will share a room 
only when I want the house demolished.” 

He checked the battered old watch that had once 
been Fabian Prewett’s. 

“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.” 

“Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told 
James as she hugged him. 

“Mum! I can’t give a professor love\” 

“But you know Neville — ” 

James rolled his eyes. 

“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor 
Longbottom, isn’t he? I can’t walk into Herbology and 
give him love. ...” 

Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he 
vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. 

“See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.” 

“I thought they were invisible? You said they were 
invisible !” 

But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to 
kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt 
onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then 
sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. 

“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told 
Albus. “They’re gentle things, there’s nothing scary 
about them. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school 
in the carriages, you’ll be going in the boats.”

Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. 

“See you at Christmas.” 

“Bye, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t 
forget Hagrid’s invited you to tea next Friday. Don’t 
mess with Peeves. Don’t duel anyone till you’ve 
learned how. And don’t let James wind you up.” 

“What if I’m in Slytherin?” 

The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew 
that only the moment of departure could have forced 
Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. 

Harry crouched down so that Albus ’s face was slightly 
above his own. Alone of Harry’s three children, Albus 
had inherited Lily’s eyes. 

“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody 
but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to 
pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the 
train, “you were named for two headmasters of 
Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was 
probably the bravest man I ever knew.” 

“But just say — ” 

“ — then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent 
student, won’t it? It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it 
matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor 
over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into 
account.” 

“Really?” 

“It did for me,” said Harry.

He had never told any of his children that before, and 
he saw the wonder in Albus’s face when he said it. 

But now the doors were slamming all along the 
scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were 
swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute 
reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny 
closed the door behind him. Students were hanging 
from the windows nearest them. A great number of 
faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned 
toward Harry. 

“Why are they all staring?” demanded Albus as he 
and Rose craned around to look at the other 
students. 

“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m 
extremely famous.” 

Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began 
to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his 
son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry 
kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a 
little bereavement, watching his son glide away from 
him. ... 

The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. 
The train rounded a corner. Harry’s hand was still 
raised in farewell. 

“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny. 

As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand 
absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his 
forehead. 

“I know he will.” 

The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All 
was well.
