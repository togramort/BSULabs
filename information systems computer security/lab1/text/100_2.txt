There is a story - I cannot tell it - I have no words. The story is almost
forgotten but sometimes I remember.
The story concerns three men in a house in a street. If I could say the
words I would sing the story. I would whisper it into the ears of women,
of mothers. I would run through the streets saying it over and over. My
tongue would be torn loose--it would rattle against my teeth.
The three men are in a room in the house. One is young and dandified.
He continually laughs.
There is a second man who has a long white beard. He is consumed with
doubt but occasionally his doubt leaves him and he sleeps.
A third man there is who has wicked eyes and who moves nervously
about the room rubbing his hands together. The three men are waiting -
waiting.
Upstairs in the house there is a woman standing with her back to a wall,
in half darkness by a window.
That is the foundation of my story and everything I will ever know is
distilled in it.
I remember that a fourth man came to the house, a white silent man.
Everything was as silent as the sea at night. His feet on the stone floor of
the room where the three men were made no sound.
The man with the wicked eyes became like a boiling liquid - he ran back
and forth like a caged animal. The old grey man was infected by his
nervousness - he kept pulling at his beard.
The fourth man, the white one, went upstairs to the woman.
There she was - waiting.
